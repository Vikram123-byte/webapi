<div>
<h2 id="secintro">Introduction</h2>

<p>This specification defines the common clipboard operations of cutting,
copying and pasting, in such a way that they are exposed to Web Applications
and can be adapted to provide advanced functionalities. Its goal is to
provide for compatibility where possible with existing implmentations.</p>

<p>Recognising that "drag and drop" operations are essentially a common user
interface extension of cut or copy, move, and paste, it also defines how the
events currently implemented for "drag and drop" operations relate to the
less device-specific approach of general clipboard operations.</p>

<p>A common interface design in the traditional <acronym>WIMP</acronym>
(Windows, Icons, Mouse Pointer) interface is to move the pointer to an icon
or to a highlighted selection, press the mouse key and drag a copy of the
icon to the target where s/he wants to drop the object, then release the
mouse key. There are, of course, many alternatives. In a graphic user
interface without a mouse a user might select an object for dragging through
a context menu, navigate to another object through standard navigation, and
then select to drop the held object.</p>
</div>

<div>
<h2 id="Cases">Use Cases and Requirements</h2>

<p>There are many use cases for being able to change the default clipboard
operations (cut/copy/paste, and the related drag-and-drop). Some samples
which are used to motivate the present work are as follows:</p>

<h3 id="Mathematic">Mathematical information</h3>

<p>With content such as mathematics, simply copying rendered text and pasting
it into another application generally leads to most of the semantics being
lost. The following example, when copied, typically adds two lines containing
the text "2 x = 7" to the clipboard. But in the MathML source of this text,
and for any human reader familiar with normal western conventions for
mathematical layout, this leads to incorrect copying. The first line would
often be better, if copied as plain text, as "2^x = 7", or if the XML source
could be placed in the clipboard with the appropriate transformation
occurring when pasting.</p>

<div class="example">
<p>Example 1: Mathematical information</p>

<p><object type="application/mathml+xml" data="res/2ex7.xml">
  The equations "2^x = 7" and "2x = 7" represented in MathML</object>
</p>
</div>

<h3 id="Rich">Rich content editing</h3>

<p>Similarly, when copying text which contains hyperlinks or other structure,
it is often useful to be able to reformat the content to preserve important
information.</p>

<p>And in order to make web applications which allow the manipulation of rich
text, or of graphic content such as SVG, it is useful to provide a mechanism
that allows for copying more than just the rendered content.</p>

<h3 id="Advanced">Advanced application interfaces</h3>

<p>Allowing for interfaces that use a thumbnail image to refer to a block of
content, which can then be dragged to insert the block of content represented
in another part of a web page. The common Drag-and-drop pardigm must be
implementable in such a way that it is accessible to users who are unable to
use a mouse (such as those on a phone where there is no mouse) and must rely
on keyboard or other interfaces.</p>
</div>

<div>
<h2 id="Conformanc">Conformance</h2>

<p>The terms <strong>must</strong>, <strong>should</strong>,
<strong>may</strong>, <strong>must not</strong>, <strong>should not</strong>,
are used in this document in accordance with [<a
href="#ref-rfc2119">RFC2119</a>]. A conformant implementation of this
specification meets all requirements identified by the use of these terms.</p>
</div>

<div>
<h2 id="Security">Security issues</h2>

<p>Enabling authors to change what is copied by a user, or to make an
automated copy of something that was never selected and allowing unrestricted
calls to paste information can raise various security concerns, especially if
these operations are allowed to transfer data across documents from different
sources. On the other hand there are valid reasons for allowing this in the
right circumstances.</p>

<p>An example scenario of a problem is where a user selects a link and copies
it, but a different link is copied to the clipboard. The effect of this can
range from an unexpected result on pasting to an attempted "phishing"
attack.</p>

<p>Authors should of course be aware that User Agents will typically restrict
what is possible to content they consider "safe", or trusted by the user. For
example, it may not be possible to launch some of the operations from script,
such as requiring an actual (not simulated or script-generated) user action
to paste or drop.</p>

<p>Implementors should carefully consider the security implications of
implementing this specification, and provide appropriate protection for users
against malicious use, such as restricting access to the functionalities
according to how trusted the source of a function call is, or informing the
user when something other than rendered content is copied to the
clipboard.</p>
</div>

<div>
<h2 id="UI">User Interface Issues</h2>

<p>This section is informative</p>

<p>This specification does not define all the user interface modes that can
be used to select content, but this section attempts to provide a survey of
some common ones. Authors and implementors should be aware that the precise
User Interface details will vary according to the use case and platform, with
different methods applying for</p>
<ul>
  <li>Mouse/Keyboard and window based interfaces</li>
  <li>Keyboard only interface</li>
  <li>Voice interfaces</li>
  <li>Stylus-based interfaces</li>
  <li>Restricted keyboards, such as on mobile telephones</li>
  <li>Multimodal interfaces, where part of an operation may be initiated
    through voice while another part is controlled through a stylus, or other
    combinations</li>
</ul>

<p>Many of these user interfaces have developed common interaction paradigms
(in the case of the common mouse/keyboard/window interface there are several
which are expected to interact seamlessly) for copy and paste at least. Other
may be less common and have no emerging convention, while other interfaces
may be developed. In each case, the events and results described below should
be mapped by the platform to particular user interaction.</p>

<p>Another method that can be used is to provide a copy/paste and copy
special/paste special set of operations, to distinguish between copying
simple or structured content to the clipboard.</p>
</div>

<div>
<h2 id="Select">Select, Cut, Copy, Paste</h2>

<p>These are well-understood operations for users. There are events fired
during selection, cut/copy and paste in some systems already which can be
captured, cancelled, and whose effects can be overwritten. In particular,
what is copied to the clipboard may be the rendered content that is selected,
or may be some other modified version. (See security implications and
annoying the user, and the setData method's ).</p>

<p>Each copy-paste operation has 4 distinct phases:</p>
<dl>
  <dt>Source Selection</dt>
    <dd>This typically uses the standard selection mechanism for the system
      User Interface to set the <a href="#source">source node</a> for any
      clipboard operation.</dd>
  <dt>Copy</dt>
    <dd>This uses the <code>setData</code> method to copy the <a
      href="#source">source node</a> to the <code>clipboardData</code>
      object. It <em>may</em> also copy the data to a
      <code>dataTransfer</code> object. <span class="issue">@@Issue: This
      makes drag and drop more flexible, e.g. for accessibility. What is the
      downside?</span></dd>
  <dt>Target Selection/Content Confirmation</dt>
    <dd>In a typical usage scenario, this will in fact be the same user
      interface mechanism that is used for Source Selection. It sets the <a
      href="#current0">current target</a>.</dd>
  <dt>Content Insertion into Target</dt>
    <dd>This fires a <code>paste</code> event on the <a
      href="#current0">current target</a>. The default effect is that where
      applicable (for example in editable text such as an input) the content
      which is held in the clipboard is inserted at the target.</dd>
</dl>

<p>The source content may be either structured or unstructured. Unstructured
content is of a single simple type such as text or an image bitmap.
Structured content is composed either of mixed content types, or a
combination of several items of the same content type. <span
class="issue">@@Issue: Actually, this isn't how it works in IE. We should
think about this bit more...</span></p>

<p>Selection may be accomplished by a number of means - see User Interface
Issues above.</p>

<p><code>copy</code> places a copy of the object selected into a clipboard.
The current selection <em>must not</em> be affected.</p>

<p><code>cut</code> <em>should</em> delete the object selected, and place it
into the clipboard. In the case of read-only content (such as a document
which is not editable by the user) the content <em>should not</em> be
removed, but a copy <em>should</em> be placed in the keyboard as for a copy
operation. <span class="issue">@@Issue: nice idea, does it reflect current
reality?</span>.</p>

<p><code>paste</code> triggers an event on the current target (usually the
current selection). <span class="issue">@@Issue: For drag and drop
compatibility should it trigger <em>drop</em> <strong>and</strong>
<em>paste</em>, or vice versa?</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<div>
<h2 id="drag-and-drop">Drag and drop processing</h2>

<p>Drag and drop is essentially a special case of a cut or copy, moving to
select some new target, and then a paste operation, which is implemented for
mouse-based devices. The main differences in drag-and-drop are that the
object being dragged is can fire a dragover event on various possible targets
before being dropped onto them, and that the object selected may be copied to
a temporary drag-specific clipboard. Compare the following phases with those
in copy and paste:</p>
<dl>
  <dt>Source Selection</dt>
    <dd>This <em>may</em> use the same user interface mechanism as for copy
      and paste (<span class="issue">@@Issue: and fire the same
      events?</span>).</dd>
  <dt>Copy Initiation</dt>
    <dd>In a typical Drag and Drop implementation, this event is initiated by
      dragging the currently selected source. This <em>must</em> fire a
      <code>dragstart</code> event. It <em>must</em> copy the <a
      href="#source">source node</a> into <code>dataTransfer</code>. It
      <em>should</em> set the <code>effectAllowed</code> property to
      determine whether a drag operation copies, moves, links, etc the source
      node. See [<a href="#ref-mdt">MDT</a>] for further documentation of how
      this works in Internet Explorer. (<span class="issue">@@Issue: Can it
      just use the copy interface? Where does dataTransfer come from? Can you
      start a drag using the existing copy buffer?</span>)</dd>
  <dt>Target Selection</dt>
    <dd>This process is repeated, and fires three events:
      <code>dragenter</code>, <code>dragover</code>, and
      <code>dragleave</code>. This <em>may</em> be the same mechanism as used
      for selection, although typical implementations provide a seperate
      mechanism. These events <code>should not</code> fired on the source, so
      until there is a <code>dragenter</code> event fired, a
      <code>drop</code> event <em>should</em> not be fired. Any action which
      would have caused a <code>drop</code> to be fired before any
      <code>dragenter</code> event has fired <em>should</em> cancel the
    drag.</dd>
  <dt>Content Insertion into Target</dt>
    <dd>When a drop operation is performed, a <code>drop</code> event is
      fired at the target. In order to protect the user from pasting
      unexpected content, user agents <em>may</em> not allow this event to be
      fired when not triggered by direct user interaction. In a drag
      operation this normally destroys the dataTransfer object. <span
      class="issue">@@Issue: what if the operation is not
    successful?</span></dd>
</dl>

<p>However it is implemented in an interface, drag and drop operations must
have a starting point (e.g. where the mouse was clicked, or the when a
<span>selection</span> or element is selected for the drag), may have any
number of intermediate steps (elements that the mouse moves over during a
drag, or elements that the user picks as possible drop points as she cycles
through possibilities), and must either have an end point (the element above
which the mouse button was released, or the element that was finally
selected), or be canceled. The end point must be the last element selected as
a possible drop point before the drop occurs. If there is no
<code>dragenter</code> event fired after a <code>dragstart</code>, then the
<code>drop</code> event <em>should</em> be cancelled, but <em>may</em> be
fired on the <a href="#source">source node</a>.</p>

<p>Then, regardless of whether the event was canceled or not, drag feedback
(e.g. the mouse cursor or other clear indication to the user) <em>should</em>
be updated to match the kind of operation indicated by the event's <code
title="dom-dataTransfer"><a href="#datatransfer0">dataTransfer</a></code>
object's <code title="dom-dataTransfer-dropEffect">dropEffect</code>
attribute, as follows: <span class="issue">@@Issue: More info about setting
the dropEffect would be useful</span></p>

<h2 id="Acknowledg">Acknowledgements</h2>

<p>This section is informative</p>

<p>The editors would like to acknowledge their intellectual debt to the
documentation of Data Transfer functionalities from Microsoft [<a
href="#ref-mdt">MDT</a>]. The draft specification of them from the WHAT
Working Group published as part of their draft "Web Applications 1.0" [<a
href="#WHAT-WA">WHAT-WA</a>] which essentially repeats the
drag-and-drop-specific parts of that were heavily used to prepare the initial
drafts of this specification. We are also grateful for the draft "safe copy
and paste" [<a href="#ref-scp">SCP</a>] from Paul Libbrecht.</p>

<p>We would like to acknowledge the contributions made by the following:</p>

<p>Shawn Carnell, Daniel Dardailler, Al Gilman, Lachlan Hunt, Aaron
Leventhal, Jim Ley, Paul Libbrecht, "Martijn", Dave Poehlman, "ROBO Design",
Janina Sajka, Rich Schwerdtfeger, Jonas Sicking, Maciej Stachowiak, Mihai
Sucan, Tom Wlodkowski</p>
