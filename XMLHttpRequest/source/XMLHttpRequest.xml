  <title>Introduction</title>
  <p><em>This section is non-normative.</em></p>
  <p>The <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> object is an interface exposed by a
   scripting engine that allows scripts to perform HTTP client functionality,
   such as submitting form data or loading data from a server. Although the
   name of the object starts with "XML", it supports the transport of other
   data formats in addition to
   <abbr title="Extensible Markup Language">XML</abbr>.  Also, some
   implementations support other protocols besides HTTP opposed to what "Http"
   in the name suggests (that functionality is not covered in this specification
   though). Furthermore, the API supports sending data as well opposed to what
   "Request" in the name suggests.</p>
  <p>The <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> object is implemented today, in some form, by
   many popular Web browsers. Unfortunately the implementations are not
   completely interoperable. The goal of this specification is to document a
   minimum set of interoperable features based on existing implementations,
   allowing Web developers to use these features without platform-specific
   code. In order to do this, only features that are already implemented are
   considered. In the case where there is a feature with no interoperable
   implementations, the authors have specified what they believe to be the most
   correct behavior. It is expected that vendors update their implementation to
   match what the specification specifies.</p>
  <p>Future versions of this specification (as opposed to future drafts of this
   version) may add new features, after careful examination from browser
   developers and Web content developers.</p>
  <section xml:id="examples">
   <title>Examples of Usage</title>
   <p><em>This section is non-normative.</em></p>
   <p>Various examples are listed throughout the specification.</p>
   <ednote>Blah...</ednote>
  </section>
  <section xml:id="security">
   <title>Security Considerations</title>
   <p><em>This section is non-normative.</em></p>
   <p>Implementations that run code originating from untrusted sources will
    probably want to place additional constraints on some of the features
    defined in this specification. This is not required and an implementation is
    free to ignore this section.</p>
   <p>The restrictions are there to stop untrusted users of the API from using
    the implementation to retrieve sensitive data. Specifically, an
    implementation in a web browser will often want to restrict pages from a
    website <var>A</var> to retrieve data from website <var>B</var>. The reason
    for this is that website <var>B</var> could reside inside a corporate
    firewall. If data could be retrieved from website <var>B</var> then website
    <var>A</var> could use the browser effectively circumvent the firewall.</p>
   <p>Another possible security attack exists if website <var>B</var> requires
    authentication, like for example a web bank. If website <var>A</var> were
    allowed to access data from website <var>B</var> and the user had recently
    visited the bank and at that time logged in, the page from website
    <var>A</var> would have access to private information like statements. If
    correctly crafted, a page from website <var>A</var> could even initiate
    transactions transferring money out of the browser-users bank account.</p>
   <p>To stop these attacks the implementation should only allow a page loaded
    from website <var>A</var> to access other pages on the same website. Two
    websites are considered separate if they use separate DNS names, even if
    these names refer to the same IP. This is because the two websites could be
    hosted at a hosting service that place several websites on a single server
    and then use the requested hostname to choose which website to serve.
    Additionally, separate TCP port numbers or separate protocols (like http vs.
    https) are considered as separate websites.</p>
   <p>The implemtation must be careful to always restrict access to the same
    website, not just during the initial HTTP request. For example if that
    request results in a redirect the implemenation should check that the
    redirect points to the same website and otherwise deny access.</p>
   <p>Another feature that an implementation could limit is the
    <code><term>setRequestHeader</term></code> method. If the implementation
    allows the <code>Host</code> header to be set and two websites are hosted
    on the same server one website might be able to access sensitive information
    from the other website.</p>
   <p>...</p>
   <ednote>Has to address restrictions on methods as well, etc.</ednote>
  </section>
  <section xml:id="definitions">
   <title>Definitions</title>
   <p>The term <dfn>entity body</dfn> is used in this specification as defined
    by RFC 2616 ([RFC2616], section 7.2.1).</p>
   <p>The term <dfn>reset</dfn> either means that respective member MUST be set
    to its initial value or each member of the object, depending on how it's
    used.</p>
   <p>The <dfn>cached base URI</dfn> MUST be
    <code>window.document.baseURI</code> once an <code>XMLHttpRequest</code>
    object is initialized. Specifically, the <code>window</code> that the
    <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> constructor comes from, not the calling
    <code>window</code> [Window].</p>
  </section>
  <section xml:id="conformance">
   <title>Conformance</title>
   <p>Everying in this specification is normative except for diagrams, examples,
    notes and sections marked non-normative.</p>
   <p>The key words MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHALL, SHALL NOT, SHOULD,
    SHOULD NOT, RECOMMENDED, MAY, and OPTIONAL in this document are to be
    interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].</p>
   <p>This specification defines some classes of products:</p>
   <dl>
    <dt>conforming implementation</dt>
    <dd>A UA that implements all interfaces described in this specification and
     follows all MUST-, REQUIRED- and SHALL-level of critera in this
     specification.</dd>
    <dt>conforming document</dt>
    <dd>A document that follows all MUST-, REQUIRED- and SHALL-level of critera
     in this specification that apply to document authors.</dd>
    <dt>conforming authoring tool</dt>
    <dd>One that produces conforming documents.</dd>
   </dl>
   <ednote>Not sure if all apply.</ednote>
  </section>
  <section xml:id="extensibility">
   <title>Extensibility</title>
   <p>Extensions to the <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> interface are reserved for
    future work by the Web APIs WG. WGs besides the Web APIs WG may extend the
    interface, but MUST coordinate that with the Web APIs WG. UAs MAY extend the
    interface, but MUST prefix the new members using a string specific to the
    vendor following the <var>Vendor</var><var>Member</var>  scheme. (Normally
    members follow the <var>member</var> scheme.) Company Foo could introduce a
    <code>FooFollowRedirect(<var>boolean</var>)</code> method for example.</p>
   <p>Authors MAY use extension mechanisms specific to the host language, like
    <code>.prototype</code> in ECMAScript.</p>
   <ednote>This should be in DOM Level 3 Core I suppose.</ednote>
  </section>
  <section xml:id="notcovered">
   <title>Not in this Specification</title>
   <p>This specification currently does not include the following features that
    may or may not be implemented by UAs. It is currently unclear whether some
    of these will be added for this version of the specification or the
    next.</p>
   <ul>
    <li><code>load</code> event and <code>onload</code> attribute;</li>
    <li><code>error</code> event and <code>onerror</code> attribute;</li>
    <li><code>progress</code> event and <code>onprogress</code> attribute;</li>
    <li><code>abort</code> event and <code>onabort</code> attribute;</li>
    <li>Timers have been suggested, perhaps an <code>ontimeout</code>
     attribute;</li>
    <li>Property to disable following redirects.</li>

  <title>The <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> Object</title>
  <p>The <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> interface may be used to allow scripts to
   programmatically connect to their originating server via HTTP.</p>
  <p>Objects implementing the <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> interface MUST also
   implement the <code>EventTarget</code> interface [DOM3EV].</p>
  <p>In ECMAScript [ECMA262], an instance of <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> can be
   created using the <code>XMLHttpRequest()</code> constructor:</p>
  <example>
   <title><code>XMLHttpRequest</code> Constructor</title>
   var r = new XMLHttpRequest();
  </example>
  <ednote>What about non-ECMAScript implementations?</ednote>
  <p>A more complete description of what can be done with
   <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> can be found in the
   <abbr title="Interface Definition Language">IDL</abbr> below and its
   associated details. The IDL is non-normative and does not intend to conform
   to [OMGIDL]. Only the language bindings are normative.</p>

      <p>If the <code><term>readyState</term></code> attribute has a value other
       than 1 (Open), an exception MUST be raised. Otherwise, the
       <code><term>readyState</term></code> attribute MUST be set to 2 (Sent)
       and a request to <var>uri</var> using method <var>method</var> is sent.
       If the <var>async</var> flag is set to false, then the method MUST not

        UTF-8 for transmission.</li>
       <li>If the <var>data</var> is a <code>Document</code>, it MUST be

       <li>If <var>data</var> is not a <code>DOMString</code> or a

      <p>Invoking <code>send</code> without the <var>data</var> argument MUST

       <code>send</code> with an argument.</p>
      <p>If the response is an HTTP redirect (status code 301, 302, 303 or 307),
       then it MUST be transparently followed (unless it violates security,
       infinite loop precautions or the scheme isn't supported). Note that HTTP
       [RFC2616] places requirements on UAs regarding the preservation of the
       request method during redirects, and also requires users to be notified
       of certain kinds of automatic redirections.</p>
      <p>If the UA allows the specification of a proxy it SHOULD modify the
       request appropriately; <abbr title="in other words">i.e.</abbr>, connect
       to the proxy host instead of the origin server, modify the
       <code>Request-Line</code> and send <code>Proxy-Authorization</code>
       headers as specified.</p>
      <p>If the UA supports HTTP Authentication [RFC2617] it SHOULD consider
       requests originating from this object to be part of the protection space
       that includes the accessed URIs and send <code>Authorization</code>
       headers and handle 401 Unauthorised requests appropriately. if
       authentication fails, UAs should prompt the users for credentials.</p>
      <p>If the UA supports HTTP State Mangement [RFC2109][RFC2965] it should
       persist, discard and send cookies (as received in the
       <code>Set-Cookie</code> and <code>Set-Cookie2</code> response headers,
       and sent in the <code>Cookie</code> header) as applicable.</p>
      <p>If the UA implements a HTTP cache [RFC2616] it should respect 
       <code>Cache-Control</code> request headers set by the author
       (<abbr title="for example">e.g.</abbr>,
       <code>Cache-Control: no-cache</code> bypasses the cache). It MUST NOT
       send <code>Cache-Control</code> or <code>Pragma</code> request headers
       automatically unless the user explicitly requests such behaviour (e.g.,
       by (force-)reloading the page). 304 Not Modified responses that are a
       result of a UA-generated conditional request MUST be presented as 200 OK
       responses with the appropriate content. Such UAs MUST allow authors to
       override automatic cache validation by setting request headers (e.g.,
       <code>If-None-Match</code>, <code>If-Modified-Since</code>), in which
       case 304 Not Modified responses MUST be passed through.</p>
      <p>If the UA implements server-driven content-negotiation [RFC2616], it
       SHOULD set <code>Accept-Language</code>, <code>Accept-Encoding</code> and
       <code>Accept-Charset</code> headers as appropriate; it MUST NOT
       automatically set the <code>Accept</code> header. Responses to such
       requests MUST have content-codings automatically removed.</p>
      <p>Immediately before receiving the message body (if any), the
       <code><term>readyState</term></code> attribute MUST be set to to 3
       (Receiving). When the request has completed loading, the
       <code><term>readyState</term></code> attribute MUST be set to 4 (Loaded).
       In case of a HEAD request <code><term>readyState</term></code> MUST be
       set to 4 (Loaded) immediatly after having gone to 3 (Receiving).</p>
      <p>If the UA supports Expect/Continue for request bodies [RFC2616] it
       SHOULD insert <code>Expect</code> headers and handle 100 Continue
