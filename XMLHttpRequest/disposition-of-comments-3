DISPOSITION OF COMMENTS
=======================

For comments made on XMLHttpRequest, W3C Working Draft published 19 November
2009. http://www.w3.org/TR/2009/WD-XMLHttpRequest-20091119/

All issues in this document are resolved or pending feedback from the
original commenter -- this document doesn't list feedback that has
been received but not yet responded to (because as soon as such
feedback is added to this list, it is responded to).

Issues are marked as follows:

   REJECTED
     reviewer's comment was rejected, but reviewer didn't respond

   AGREED
     reviewer's comment was accepted, but reviewer didn't respond

   PENDING
     reviewer needs to comment further before issue can be addressed

   CLOSED
     reviewer explicitly closed the issue without disagreement

   DISAGREE
     editor and reviewer disagree, editor is not sure how to continue

   FORMAL OBJECTION
     reviewer disagreed with all responses

The "Status" and/or "Summary" fields are not included if it wouldn't provide
more information than the above.

URIs marked with '(WG)' are replies by Working Group Members. They do not
necessarily reflect the opinion of the whole Working Group, but are
considered to be sufficient in case there is no disagreement over the
response within the Working Group.
