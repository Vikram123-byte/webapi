  </div>

  <div class="section"><h2 id="functional-requirements">1. Functional Requirements</h2>
    
    <p>
      These requirements cover what pertains directly to the functionality
      desired in REX.
    </p>
    <dl>
      <dt><em class="rfc2119" title="Keyword in RFC 2119 context">MUST</em> permit a document tree to be modified, locally or remotely</dt>
      <dd>
        It must be possible, through use of REX, to cause a remote document tree
        to be updated as if by manipulation through the <acronym title="Document Object Model">DOM</acronym> 3 Core API. This does
        not entail that all of the <acronym title="Document Object Model">DOM</acronym> 3 Core API needs be exposed, simply that
        it must be possible to perform modifications corresponding to the
        following <acronym title="Document Object Model">DOM</acronym> 3 Events events: DOMNodeInserted, DOMNodeRemoved, 
        DOMAttrModified, and DOMCharacterDataModified.
      </dd>
      <dt><em class="rfc2119" title="Keyword in RFC 2119 context">MUST</em> rely on an event-based processing model</dt>
      <dd>
        The chosen method of providing orthogonality across <acronym title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</acronym> specifications
        covering interaction languages is to communicate both across and
        within language boundaries using events. This ensures the integrity of
        the processing model, and that minimal information be available
        between the various parts that may be integrated within a user-agent.
        This is of specific importance where REX is concerned, since it cannot
        be useful without a tree to target that is presumably in another
        language. The baseline event specification with which to conform
        is <acronym title="Document Object Model">DOM</acronym> 3 Events.
      </dd>
      <dt><em class="rfc2119" title="Keyword in RFC 2119 context">MUST</em> support multiple Document Object Model variants</dt>
      <dd>
        Multiple technologies on the Web support multiple Document Object
        Models, some of which are standard or being standardised (e.g. <acronym title="Document Object Model">DOM</acronym>
        3 Core, <acronym title="Document Object Model">DOM</acronym> 2 HTML, <acronym title="Scalable Vector Graphics">SVG</acronym> <acronym title="Document Object Model">DOM</acronym> 1.1, <acronym title="Scalable Vector Graphics">SVG</acronym> Tiny 1.2 uDOM) while others are
        found "in the wild" and may be de facto variants specific to a domain
        or to an implementation. In as far as technically reasonable, REX must
        support targeting multiple such object models.
      </dd>
      <dt><em class="rfc2119" title="Keyword in RFC 2119 context">MUST</em> specify a minimal timing model</dt>
      <dd>
        In order to properly support the ability to be transmitted over
        streaming protocols, REX must support timing facilities (at least
        to differentiate between delivery time and activation time). However 
        these facilities must be limited to the strict set that is required
        to achieve the ability to be streamed and must not overlap with
        existing protocols.
      </dd>
      <dt><em class="rfc2119" title="Keyword in RFC 2119 context">MUST</em> support addressing nodes using XPath</dt>
      <dd>
        The proven way of addressing nodes in the <acronym title="Extensible Markup Language">XML</acronym> stack is to rely
        on XPath. The support for XPath required in REX may be a subset
        of XPath 1.0.
      </dd>
    </dl>
  </div>

  <div class="section"><h2 id="format-requirements">2. Format Requirements</h2>
    
    <p>
      These requirements cover how the functionality available in REX
      is to be captured by a format, and what constraints this format
      is to follow.
    </p>
    <dl>
      <dt><em class="rfc2119" title="Keyword in RFC 2119 context">MUST</em> be specified in a declarative manner</dt>
      <dd>
        REX must support functionality that is currently possible using
        scripting, but without introducing the level of complexity and
        functionality that a scripting language permits. A simpler, more limited
        declarative approach is easier to handle on constrained platforms
        and high-performance environments.
      </dd>
      <dt><em class="rfc2119" title="Keyword in RFC 2119 context">MUST</em> be expressed in an <acronym title="Extensible Markup Language">XML</acronym> syntax </dt>
      <dd>
        In order to better integrate into the <acronym title="Extensible Markup Language">XML</acronym> and Web stacks, and
        as a straightforward manner of specifying a declarative language
        compared to inventing a completely new syntax, REX needs to be 
        expressed in <acronym title="Extensible Markup Language">XML</acronym>.
      </dd>
      <dt><em class="rfc2119" title="Keyword in RFC 2119 context">MUST</em> be extensible</dt>
      <dd>
        It must be possible to create new versions of REX as well as
        proprietary extensions to it without interfering with the way in
        which an implementation of the current version that is unaware of
        extensions processes the parts of the content that are not
        extensions. Such extensions cover both the markup in which REX
        is expressed and the events that it captures.
      </dd>
      <dt><em class="rfc2119" title="Keyword in RFC 2119 context">MUST</em> support be forwards and backwards compatibility</dt>
      <dd>
        REX must be specified in such a way that new vocabulary items
        (e.g. elements, attributes) and new events can be easily added
        in version n+1 content without causing implementations of version 
        n to abort processing, and so that implementations of versions 
        n+1 can still process the entirety of version n content.
      </dd>
      <dt><em class="rfc2119" title="Keyword in RFC 2119 context">MUST</em> precisely define error handling</dt>
      <dd>
        Error handling must be defined in such a way that user-agents 
        will interpret non-conformant content in an interoperable 
        manner.
      </dd>
    </dl>
  </div>

  <div class="section"><h2 id="ecosystem-requirements">3. Ecosystem Requirements</h2>
    
    <p>
      These requirements cover the way in which REX needs to integrate
      with the existing ecosystem of surrounding specifications.
    </p>
    <dl>
      <dt><em class="rfc2119" title="Keyword in RFC 2119 context">MUST</em> integrate into the QA framework </dt>
      <dd>
        The REX specification must take into account all relevant
        QA requirements, in such a manner that these requirements
        can be easily verified.
      </dd>
      <dt><em class="rfc2119" title="Keyword in RFC 2119 context">MUST</em> be applicable to any <acronym title="Extensible Markup Language">XML</acronym> language</dt>
      <dd>
        REX needs to be specified so that it is not a silo technology 
        that only operates on one <acronym title="Extensible Markup Language">XML</acronym> language, or a subset of possible
        <acronym title="Extensible Markup Language">XML</acronym> languages, but rather a general technology that can be
        reused across the board.
      </dd>
      <dt><em class="rfc2119" title="Keyword in RFC 2119 context">SHOULD</em> be implementable on top of <acronym title="Scalable Vector Graphics">SVG</acronym> Tiny 1.2 uDOM</dt>
      <dd>
        The <acronym title="Scalable Vector Graphics">SVG</acronym> Tiny 1.2 uDOM provides a convenient measure of a
        <acronym title="Document Object Model">DOM</acronym> subset that corresponds to the requirements of constrained
        devices. Ensuring that this specification can be implemented
        on the uDOM is a practical way of assessing whether it can
        be supported on mobile devices.
      </dd>

      <dd>
        The <acronym title="Extensible Markup Language">XML</acronym> stack is now so vast that checking a new specification
        for applicability to others is at best impractical. This requirement
        is to support the

        specifications that provide additional features considered to form the 
        <acronym title="Extensible Markup Language">XML</acronym> Stack. A format is said to integrate well into the <acronym title="Extensible Markup Language">XML</acronym> Stack if it 
        can easily find its place into the large body of <acronym title="Extensible Markup Language">XML</acronym>-related technologies,

      <dd>
        In order to be reusable across a large set of varied networks, REX must
        not rely on excessive requirements from the transport layer that it is
        being delivered on top of. This requirement is to support the
        <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xbc-properties/#transport-independence">Transport Independence</a>
