      This specification defines an <acronym title='Extensible Markup Language'>XML</acronym>
      [XML] grammar intended for representing events as they are defined in
      <acronym title='Document Object Model'>DOM</acronym> 3 Events [DOM3EV], primarily
      but not exclusively for purposes of transmission. It enables one endpoint to interact remotely with
      another endpoint holding a DOM representation by sending it DOM Events as if they
      had occurred directly at the same location.

    <title>Overview</title>

    <p>
      The <strong>Remote Events for XML</strong> (<acronym title='Remote Events for XML'>REX</acronym>) specification 
      defines a <a href='http://www.w3.org/TR/xbc-properties/#transport-independence'>transport agnostic</a> 
      XML syntax for the transmission of DOM events as specified in the DOM 3 Events
      specification [DOM3EV] in such a way as to be compatible with streaming protocols. REX assumes that the transport
      provides for reliable, timely and in sequence delivery of REX messages. REX does not cover the process of session 
      initiation and termination which are presumed to be handled by other means.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first version of this specification deliberately restricts itself to the transmission of mutation
      events so as to remain limited in scope and allow for progressive enhancements to implementations
      over time rather than require a large specification to be deployed at once. The framework
      specified here is however compatible with the transmission of any other event type, and
      great care has been taken to ensure its extensibility and evolvability.
    </p>
    
    <section xml:id='usage'>
      <title>Examples of usage</title>

      <p>
        A variety of usage situations in for which REX can be used are exemplified
        below, also showing some specific features available when using REX.
      </p>
      
      <section xml:id='eg-setattr'>
        <title>Setting an attribute</title>
        <p>
          The following REX message sets the <code>fetch</code> attribute to "ball"
          on an element that has an ID of <code>spot</code>.
        </p>

        <example>
          <title>Setting an attribute</title>

          <rex xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2006/rex'>
            <event target='id("spot")/@fetch' name='DOMAttrModified' newValue='ball'/>
          </rex>
          ]]>
        </example>
        
        <p>
          Note that we do not specify the <at el='DOMAttrModified'>attrChange</at>
          attribute since the default handles both modification and addition.
          The event that will be dispatched will automatically reflect whether an
          attribute had to be created or if it already existed and simply had its
          value changed.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section xml:id='eg-addelem'>
        <title>Inserting an element</title>
        <p>
          The following REX message adds a row at the seventh position (that is,
          after the current sixth and before the current seventh, which becomes the
          eighth) in the second table contained in the document's body.
        </p>

      <section xml:id='eg-delelem'>
        <title>Removing an element</title>
        <p>
          The following REX message removes <em>all</em> circle elements 
          that are children of the element with id <code>poodle-stylist-location-layer</code>.
        </p>

        <example>
          <title>Removing several elements</title>
          <![CDATA[
          <rex xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2006/rex' xmlns:svg='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'>

          </rex>
          ]]>
        </example>
        
        <p>
          This shows how REX capitalises on the expressivity of XPath to perform 
          multiple operations with a single command that is concise and network
          efficient. This capability is not limited to node removal, the processing
          model allows any event to be dispatched to multiple nodes.
        </p>

      <section xml:id='eg-repelem'>
        <title>Replacing an element</title>
        <p>
          The following REX message replaces an element with ID <code>femur</code>
          with the new one provided in the payload.
        </p>

        <example>
          <title>Replacing an element</title>
          <![CDATA[
          <rex xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2006/rex'>

          </rex>
          ]]>
        </example>
        
        <p>
          Replacement is expressed as a removal with a payload. The processing model
          is exactly the same as if an event had been transmitted indicating removal,
          followed by another indicating insertion (internally, a REX user-agent 
          processes both in the exact same manner — which also matches the manner in
          which a DOM implementation would perform this task) but this shorthand 
          simplifies content generation and is more efficient both in bandwidth and
          in processing time (since the target only needs to be resolved once).
        </p>
      </section>

      <section xml:id='eg-newdoc'>
        <title>Replacing the entire document</title>
        <p>
          The following REX message replaces an entire SVG document with a new one.
        </p>

        <example>
          <title>Replacing an entire document</title>
          <![CDATA[
          <rex xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2006/rex'>

        </example>
        
        <p>
          Again, XPath's simple modelling of a document hierarchy is used to
          address the node we want to replace, in this case the document node
          captured simply as "<code>/</code>".

        <title>Updating text</title>
        <p>
          All nodes, including text, can be updated directly. However character
          data has specific events in the DOM that are more straightforward and
          can be more lightweight to use. REX supports encapsulating such
          updates as well. The following example updates the seventh <code>tspan</code>
          element's textual data with new text.

    <title>Structure of a REX message</title>

    <p>
      The namespace for the REX language is: <code>http://www.w3.org/2006/rex</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Future versions of this specification will use the same namespace, unless the
      language is changed in such radical ways that an implementation of previous versions would
      not be able to process it in a meaningful manner. Implementations of this specification
      therefore MUST be able to process extensions to the syntax defined in this version,
      as detailed in the <a href='#extensibility'>Extensibility</a> section.
    </p>
    <p>
      All REX messages MUST be contained within a <el>rex</el> element. REX messages MAY be
      contained within other XML elements in other namespaces, but each REX fragment MUST
      still have a <el>rex</el> element as its root.
    </p>

    <section xml:id='elem-rex'>
      <title>The <el>rex</el> element</title>

      <p>
        The <el>rex</el> element serves as the root container for the entire REX message.
        It MUST be present, even if there is only one <el>event</el> element. Elements in
        the REX namespace that do not have a <el>rex</el> ancestor MUST be ignored by
        the user-agent.

        <dd>
          Indicates the minimum version of the REX specification required to usefully process this message.
          While the version value has the form of a float it is actually processed as a string and 
          user-agents MUST therefore compare the provided <at el='rex'>minimal-version</at> against the strings
          of all versions that they know and MUST NOT perform numeric comparisons. This entails that
          <code>1.0</code>, <code>1</code>, or <code>1.00</code> are all different versions.
          A user-agent supporting this version of the specification MUST accept version identifier
          <code>1.0</code>. If the version number is not in the list of versions of this specification
          supported by the user-agent, the user-agent MUST reject the message completely and
          immediately, ignoring the entirety of its content.

        <dt id='attr-rex-target-document'>target-document</dt>
        <dd>
          In some cases a user-agent may have multiple document in memory, or even inside
          the current view. The <at>target-document</at> attribute is used to identify
          which document is being addressed by this given REX message. Its content is an
          opaque string, and the manner in which the user-agent maps such identifiers to
          the documents that it contains as well as the absence of a <at>target-document</at>
          identifier to a "default" or "active" document is left for the target environments 
          to define. An empty <at>target-document</at> MUST be processed as if the attribute
          had not been specified. If a user-agent receives a REX message with a 
          <at>target-document</at> that it cannot map onto a document then the entire REX
          message MUST be ignored.

      <title>The <at>ns</at> attribute</title>

      <p>
        The <at>ns</at> attribute defines the namespace that applies to DOM event names within the
        scope of the element on which it occurs. For any given DOM event name, if there is no
        <at>ns</at> attribute on any of its ancestor elements, that event name's URI component is

        elements in reverse document order. The content of the <at>ns</at> attribute is either
        an IRI or the empty string. If the empty string then event names in its applicable 
        scope will have no namespace URI component.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the <at>ns</at> attribute contains a non-empty string, then it SHOULD be a valid IRI.
        However, given the complexity involved in checking IRI validity it is NOT RECOMMENDED
        that user-agents validate them. If however IRI validation is performed and the IRI value
        of the <at>ns</at> attribute is found to be false, then the entire subtree inclusive of 
        the element on which the <at>ns</at> attribute occurs MUST be ignored.

      Target nodes are referenced using a <a href='#path-syntax'>subset of XPath</a> [XPATH]
      that corresponds to the level of expressivity that meets most needs while at the same 
      time remaining easy to implement. There is never a need to resolve a relative path as

    <section xml:id='processing-paths'>
      <title>Processing target paths</title>
      <p>
        Target paths MUST be processed as follows, even if internal details of implementation
        differ. The result of evaluating the target path against the target document is
        a node-set, ordered according to the axes used in the target path, as per XPath.
        Note however that the limited set of axes available in this subset will always 
        cause the node-set to be in document order unless a superset of the minimal
        syntax is used.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the size of the node-set is superior to one, only the first item in that node-set

      <!--

        If the size of the node-set is superior to one, the event MUST be dispatched in the exact

        element had been copied multiple times in a row in the REX message, and each had had
        its target path modified to match only the corresponding node in the node-set. If an

        that event MUST be ignored, and the remaining expanded events MUST be processed.

        If the size of the node-set is zero, the event MUST be ignored and thus nothing happens.

        The set of namespace declarations made available to the target path are those in scope
        on the element on which the target path occurs; this includes the implicit declaration
        of the prefix <code>xml</code> required by Namespaces in XML [XMLNS]; the default namespace
        (as declared by <code>xmlns</code>) is <em>not</em> part of this set.

      <title>Path syntax</title>
      
      <p>
        The syntax for target paths is a very simple subset of XPath described by the following
        syntax, in which the <code>Name</code> token is taken from the XML specification [XML]
        and the <code>NCName</code> token is from the Namespaces in XML specification [XMLNS].
      </p>
      
      <schema>
        <title>EBNF for target paths</title>
        <ebnf>
          FullPath  ::= RPath | Root | IDPath
          SubPath   ::= Step* FullTest
          RPath     ::= '/' SubPath
          Root      ::= '/'
          IDPath    ::= 'id(' NCNameStr ')' RPath?
          Step      ::= StepTest '/'
          StepTest  ::= Name ('[' Num ']')?
          FullTest  ::= (Name | 'text()') ('[' Num ']')?
          NCNameStr ::= "'" NCName "'" | '"' NCName '"'
          Num       ::= [0-9]+
        </ebnf>
      </schema>
      
      <p>
        User-agents MAY support a superset of this syntax so long as it is a valid instance of
        the XPath language [XPATH]. Content producers however SHOULD NOT use such extensions
        as they hamper interoperability.
      </p>
      <p>
        The subset of XPath normatively defined in the above grammar can be summarised by a
        few general ideas. Target paths may only begin at the root or with an <code>id()</code>
        function. The <code>id()</code> function itself is limited to a single string argument,
        which in turn must contain exactly one identifier (as opposed to a white space separated
        list in XPath). Only abbreviated axes are supported in the syntax. Following the
        beginning of the path may be a list of steps, making use only of the child 
        axis, and only element name tests. The final step in the list is more
        powerful and may also reference text nodes. For each step a predicate may
        be used, which is limited to only containing an integer indicating position.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some examples of target paths include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <code>/svg:svg</code> will match the root <code>svg</code> element, in the namespace
          that has been bound to the 'svg' prefix.
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>/lodges/donkey[8]</code> will match the eighth <code>donkey</code> element in the
          <code>lodges</code> element with no namespace.
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>/</code> will match the root node, which is to say the document itself.
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>/foo/text()</code> will match the first text node that is a child of the
          the <code>foo</code> element.
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>/xhtml:html/xhtml:body/svg:svg[3]</code> will match the third <code>svg</code> 
          element that is a child of the root <code>body</code> and then <code>html</code> 
          elements.
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>id("dahut")</code> will match the element with ID 'dahut'.
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>id("dahut")/svg:circle</code> will match the first <code>circle</code> element
          that is a child of the element with ID 'dahut'.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Note that it is possible using this syntax to produce target paths that will never match
        anything (for instance <code>/element[2]</code>). Such constructions simply cause the 
        event to be ignored.

  <section xml:id='processing'>
    <title>Processing model</title>

    <p>
      This section defines how REX messages are processed by user-agents. Its intent is not to 
      prescribe implementation details — the processing MAY be implemented in ways that differ
      from the steps described below, but if so the effect MUST be exactly equivalent.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is RECOMMENDED that REX messages be processed in a streaming fashion, so that the user-agent
      is not required to build a tree representation of the message. This is of particular importance
      in that a single REX message MAY capture a very long list of individual events over a long
      period of time, which would cause the resulting tree to consume potentially large amounts of
      memory.
    </p>
    <p>
      Events MUST be dispatched in the same order in which they occur in the REX message.
    </p>
    <p>
      Implementations SHOULD dispatch events encoded in REX messages as soon as they have finished
      parsing the corresponding <el>event</el> element. Because of this a REX message containing
      a well-formedness error SHOULD still cause previous <el>event</el> elements to be
      fully processed. Upon encountering a well-formedness error, a REX user-agent MUST stop processing
      immediately such that the remainder of the XML document MUST be ignored. If the well-formedness 
      error is contained inside an <el>event</el> element, the corresponding event MUST also be ignored.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as an <el>event</el> element is parsed, and provided that it is not
      ignored according to this specification, the following steps take place:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        an <code>Event</code> object (as defined in DOM 3 Events [DOM3EV]) MUST be created as defined
        in the <a href='#proc-mapping-ev'>Mapping event elements to Event objects</a>
        section below. Note that in some cases, multiple <code>Event</code> objects may be created
        by a single <el>event</el> element (e.g. for the <ev>DOMNodeRemoved</ev> event).
      </li>
      <li>
        the target path MUST be resolved, as defined in <a href='#referencing'>Referencing
        target nodes</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        if the previous step produced a node and it is not ignored according to this specification, 
        the event or events initialised in step 1 MUST be dispatched as if by a call to 
        <a href='http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-3-Events/events.html#Events-EventTarget-dispatchEvent'>EventTarget.dispatchEvent()</a>.
        If the event is defined to have side-effect (such as modifying the DOM tree,
        as is the case with <a href='#mutation'>mutation events</a>), this is the moment
        at which the side-effect MUST occur. Whether the side-effect occurs immediately
        preceding or following the event being dispatched is specified for each such
        event.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      As soon as an <el>event</el> element has been processed, the implementation MAY discard it
      from memory so as to consume fewer resources.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is no requirement on the user-agent to support a DOM interface in order to still implement
      events received through REX messages. For instance, specifications such as SMIL [SMIL2]
      or XML Events [XMLEV] may be handling events received through REX messages in the absence
      of a DOM representation of the document tree.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that user-agents that support the <a href='#streaming'>Streaming Module</a> have to
      support a slightly more elaborate processing model that, in the case of timed events,
      has different requirements in terms of the order in which events are to be processed
      and the immediacy of their dispatch.
    </p>
    
    <section xml:id='proc-mapping-ev'>
      <title>Mapping <el>event</el> elements to Event objects</title>
      <p>
        In processing <el>event</el> elements and converting them into Event objects,

      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt>type</dt>
        <dd>
          Set to the <at el='event'>name</at> attribute of the <el>event</el> element.
        </dd>
        <dt>namespaceURI</dt>
        <dd>
          Set to URI equivalent of the value of the <at>ns</at> attribute, resolved as described in its
          own section.
        </dd>
        <dt>target</dt>
        <dd>
          Set dynamically to be in turn each node in the node-set obtained by resolving
          the target path.
        </dd>
        <dt>currentTarget</dt>
        <dd>
          Set dynamically as the event is being processed, as described in the
          <a href='http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-3-Events/events.html#Events-flow'>DOM event flow</a>.
        </dd>
        <dt>eventPhase</dt>
        <dd>
          Set dynamically depending on whether the event is currently progressing
          through the capture, target, or bubble phase. Note that this specification
          does not require that given phases be supported by the implementation, this
          is left to the specifications with which it is used in conjunction to define.
        </dd>
        <dt>bubbles</dt>
        <dd>
          Specifies whether an event is one that bubbles or not. The implementation
          sets that using its knowledge of the given event type.
        </dd>
        <dt>cancelable</dt>
        <dd>
          Specifies whether an event can have its default action prevented or not. 
          The implementation sets that using its knowledge of the given event type.
        </dd>
        <dt>timeStamp</dt>
        <dd>
          If the implementation supports the <at el='event'>timeStamp</at> attribute and it
          has been set, this field specifies the time at which the event comes into
          effect. As defined in the DOM 3 Events specification [DOM3EV] if this
          field is not specified, it MUST always be set to zero.
        </dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        When the event type is recognised by the processor, it needs to create an
        object of the appropriate subclass of Event. The precise details of doing
        so are defined in the sections that handle mappings of specific event
        types. In this specification there is only one such section, 
        <a href='#mutation'>Encoding Mutation Events</a>.

        <li>
          Events the names of which do not match any known event in the version of the specification supported

        <li>
          Events which the user-agent understands as being defined in the specification but that have no
          meaningful effect within the context in which the user-agent operates (e.g. a <code>mousemove</code>
          event on a device that has no pointer device cursor).
        </li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>
        When encountering an unknown even, a user-agent MUST ignore the entire <el>event</el> element and
        all its descendants.
      </p>
      <ednote>
        <p>
          Note that we could make this extensible, but it would require adding a bunch of
          attributes (bubbles, cancellable, etc.) so that unknown events could be processed.
          This should be done in the next version.

    <section xml:id='proc-ukn-nodes'>
      <title>Processing unsupported node types</title>
      
      <p>
        There is almost always a mismatch between the information that an XML document
        is able to capture and the information that an in-memory representation of the
        same document is able to expose. In some cases, this mismatch is strong enough
        that some major XML constructs such as processing instructions or comments cannot
        be represented. This section defines how a user-agent is to handle node types that
        it is unable to produce a representation of.
      </p>
      <p>
        It should be noted that there is no requirement that a node type captured in a REX
        message have a corresponding object or interface in the DOM variant used by the
        user-agent. For instance, the SVG 1.2 MicroDOM [SVGT12] has no interface to 
        represent text nodes but it is nevertheless able to store text content and even
        mixed content. Therefore a user-agent using the MicroDOM will be able to process
        text nodes that it receives from REX messages.
      </p>
      <p>
        The are two situations in which unsupported node types may be encountered:
      </p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>
          If the <at el='event'>target</at> attribute points to one such node type, either directly (i.e. at the
          end of the target path) or indirectly (i.e. as a step in the target path).
        </li>
        <li>
          In the payload of the <el>event</el> element.
        </li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>
        If the target path requires support for a node type that is not supported by the
        implementation, then the user-agent MUST ignore the entire <el>event</el> element and
        all of its descendants.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the payload of the <el>event</el> element contains node types that are not supported
        by the user-agent's DOM implementation the payload MUST be modified so that nodes
        that have no usable representation in the user-agent's DOM implementation are removed.
        For instance, given an SVG Tiny 1.2 MicroDOM [SVGT12], processing instructions would be
        removed as they can have no known impact or representation in the tree, but text nodes
        would not: they may not have an object type corresponding to them but they are still
        accessible through the <code>textContent</code> interface. If removing these nodes
        from the payload causes the payload to become empty, then the entire <el>event</el>
        element MUST be ignored since no useful Event object could be derived from it.

    <title>Extensibility</title>

    <p>
      In order for REX to be extensible, it is necessary to define a strict extensibility model
      that allows future versions to introduce new constructs into messages that will still
      be understood to the best of their abilities by older user-agents.
    </p>
    <p>
      A REX message that is intended to be understood if and only if the user-agent supports
      a minimal version of the REX specification MUST set the <at el='rex'>minimal-version</at> attribute
      correspondingly. A user-agent that does not support the required version MUST then discard
      the entire message. Otherwise, it MUST apply the following forward-compatibility rules.
    </p>

      <p>
        Outside of <el>event</el> payloads, when encountering an unknown element a user-agent
        MUST ignore it together with all of its attributes and descendant nodes.

      <p>
        Inside <el>event</el> payloads, all elements whether they are in the REX namespace
        or not are considered to constitute the content of that event, and MUST be processed

      <title>Errors specific to the DOM or to the target language</title>

        Some of the events that can be captured in REX messages will cause the DOM tree

        specified in the respective event definitions, the following rules apply:
      </p>
      <dl>

          If the modification corresponds to something that is invalid in the DOM

          is ignored.
        </dd>
        <dt>Target language errors</dt>
        <dd>
          If the modification causes the target language to find itself in a state
          that is erroneous according to its specification, the modification takes place
          regardless and it is up to the host language to handle the error, as if the 
          modification had been performed through script manipulation of the DOM. The
          exception to this rule is if such a modification being performed by using the
          DOM directly had caused an exception to be raised: in that case the error
          is treated as a DOM error, and the event is ignored.

        However if instead of a user-agent the REX processor is a content checker, then

        The <a href='http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-3-Events/events.html#event-DOMNodeInserted'>DOMNodeInserted</a>
        indicates that a node has been inserted into the DOM tree. The inserted node MUST be either of an element,
        a text node, a comment, or a processing instruction. The target path is used to specify the parent of
        the node that is to be inserted, and MUST point either to an element or to the document root. If the
        element that it points to does not exist then the event MUST be ignored.
      </p>
      <p>
        After all direct child elements of the <el>event</el> element that are in the REX namespace
        have been removed together with their descendants, the remaining child nodes constitute the event's
        payload. If there is more than one remaining child node in the payload, they MUST be inserted one after
        the other in document order, as if a DOM DocumentFragment were being inserted. Each of
        them in turn MUST produce a 
        <a href='http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-3-Events/events.html#event-DOMNodeInserted'>DOMNodeInserted</a>
        event as if they had been transmitted in separate <el>event</el> elements, and the 
        <at el='DOMNodeInserted'>position</at> MUST be incremented by one for each.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that as specified in DOM 3 Events [DOM3EV] this event MUST be dispatched <em>after</em> 
        the node has been inserted.
      </p>
      <p>
        When this event is transmitted, the <el>event</el> element MUST allow arbitrary XML as its content.
        This is not specified in the schema fragment below but left to compounding schemata (e.g.
        using NVDL) to define.

          Specifies the position at which the payload MUST be inserted in the target element's
          child nodes such that a hypothetical call to <code>parent.childNodes.item(position)</code>
          would return the first node of the payload. If position is not specified, or if the specified
          value is higher than the number of item or lower than zero then the nodes MUST be inserted
          at the end of the list of child nodes.
        </dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        Please note that the payload of <ev>DOMNodeInserted</ev> events MUST NOT be normalised prior to
        insertion and therefore that indentation, if undesirable in the targeted result, has to be
        absent from the event payload as well. For instance, given the following target tree:
      </p>
      <example>
        <title>Source document</title>

      <title>The <ev>DOMNodeRemoved</ev> event</title>

      <p>
        The <a href='http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-3-Events/events.html#event-DOMNodeRemoved'>DOMNodeRemoved</a> event
        indicates that a node has been removed from the DOM tree. The target path MUST point to either an element,
        a text node, a comment, or a processing instruction. If it points to an attribute the event MUST be
        ignored. If the node pointed to by the target path does not exist, then the event MUST be ignored.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the <el>event</el> element capturing this has a payload as defined in the <ev>DOMNodeInserted</ev>
        event, then a second event MUST be created and dispatched immediately after this event (if the target path
        resolved to a node-set containing more than one item, then each generated event immediately
        follows the one dispatched on a given node).
      </p>
      <p>
        The following parameters MUST be set for the generated event. It is of type 
        <ev>DOMNodeInserted</ev>. Its target node is the parent of the one pointed to
        by the current <ev>DOMNodeRemoved</ev> event, unless the latter was pointing 
        to the root node (using '<code>/</code>') in which case the generated event
        also points to the root node. Its <at el='DOMNodeInserted'>position</at> is 
        that of the removed node within its siblings, in document order. Its payload 
        is set to be that of the current event.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that the above processing is compatible with that of DOM 3 Core [DOM3] 
        <a href='http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-3-Core/core.html#ID-785887307'>Node.replaceChild()</a>

        event indicates that an attribute has been modified, added, or removed.
      </p>
      <p>
        When representing a <ev>DOMAttrModified</ev> event, the <el>event</el>
        element's <at el='event'>target</at> attribute MUST point to an element node.
        That element node is the one on which the attribute pointed to by 
        <at el='DOMAttrModified'>attrName</at> is to be modified, added, or removed.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the <at el='DOMAttrModified'>attrChange</at> attribute is set to <code>removal</code>

        and good practices from the <a href='http://www.w3.org/TR/qaframe-spec/'>QA Framework:
        Specification Guidelines</a> [QAF-SPEC]. For each requirement and good
        practice, the table links to the part of the REX specification that 
        satisfies the requirement or best practice, except where the entry
        corresponds to many parts of the specification, or even the specification
        as a whole.

      <title>Optional features</title>
      <p>
        There are two features for which optionality is to be found:
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt>Processing XML as a stream</dt>
        <dd>
          There are two major manners in which XML may be processed: either the
          processor performs actions as soon as a given token in the source is
          parsed (this is generally referred to as processing in a "streaming"
          fashion), or the entire document is first parsed into an in-memory
          representation and then walked through to perform actions (a.k.a. 
          tree-based processing). The major difference between the two as far
          as this specification is concerned is that an implementation processing
          XML in a streaming fashion will dispatch events that it has parsed in
          their entirety immediately even if there is an XML well-formedness error
          further into the document, whereas tree-based processing will detect the
          well-formedness problem before any action is taken. Since it is
          preferable at least for performance reasons to process documents in a 
          streaming manner, the specification recommends that approach but does not
          mandate it. We did not wish to enforce only one kind, as both may be 
          impractical, if only because some constrained devices will only have 
          one type of processing or the other.
        </dd>
        <dt>Support for varied DOM representations</dt>
        <dd>
          This specification has be created with the goal of being reusable in
          many situations, notably in case in which the DOM support of the
          user-agent may vary greatly, and in fact in some cases be to some
          degree absent (which is to say, there needs to be a tree representation
          that can usefully be understood as a DOM, but it need not be exposed for
          instance to scripting). To enforce this would have severely reduced the
          applicability of this specification. Instead, it describes normatively
          how to handle node types that cannot be usefully represented in the
          user-agent's DOM of choice.

      The editor would like to thank Dave Raggett for his excellent input and comments. This
      specification is a collective work that derives from other solutions in the domain. Notable 
      amongst its initial influences are an input document from Nokia the ideas from which were
      incorporated into this specification, <a href='http://xmldb-org.sourceforge.net/xupdate/'>XUpdate</a>
      which has been a major de facto solution since the year 2000 and was influential in
      REX's technical design, and the <a href='http://www.w3.org/TR/xup'>XUP</a> 
      W3C Member Submission (now <a href='http://openxup.org'>OpenXUP</a>) from which much
      inspiration was drawn.

            The encoding of a REX document MUST be determined by the XML
            encoding declaration. This has identical semantics to the 
            application/xml media type in the case where the charset 
            parameter is omitted, as specified in RFC 3023 [RFC3023] sections
            8.9, 8.10 and 8.11.

        <dd>
          <p>
            As with other XML types and as noted in RFC 3023 [RFC3023] section 10,
            repeated expansion of maliciously constructed XML entities can be used
            to consume large amounts of memory, which may cause XML processors in
            some environments to fail. 
          </p>
          <p>
            REX documents may be transmitted in compressed form using gzip compression.
            For systems which employ MIME-like mechanisms, such as HTTP, this is 
            indicated by the Content-Encoding header; for systems which do not, 
            such as direct file system access, this is indicated by the file name 
            extension or file metadata. In addition, gzip compressed content is 
            readily recognised by the initial byte sequence as described in 
            RFC 1952 [RFC1952] section 2.3.1. 
          </p>
          
          <p>
            It must be noted that REX events MAY be used to modify the document that
            they target, and in fact that is the primary functionality that they expose
            in version 1.0. Such modifications may cause security issues with the processor
            of the target document, but those issues are outside the scope of this 
            registration document.
          </p>

          <p>
            In addition, because of the extensibility features for REX and of XML in
            general, it is possible that "<code>application/rex+xml</code>" may describe
            content that has security implications beyond those described here. However,
            if the processor follows only the normative semantics of this specification,
            this content will be outside the REX namespace and MUST be ignored. Only in 
            the case where the processor recognises and processes the additional content,
            or where further processing of that content is dispatched to other processors,
            would security issues potentially arise. And in that case, they would fall 
            outside the domain of this registration document. 
          </p>

        </dd>

        <dt>Interoperability considerations:</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>
            This specification describes processing semantics that dictate behaviour that
            must be followed when dealing with, among other things, unrecognised elements,
            events, and attributes, both in the REX and XML Events namespaces and in other 
            namespaces. 
          </p>

          <p>
            Because REX is extensible, conformant "<code>application/rex+xml</code>" 
            processors MUST expect that content received is well-formed XML, but it 
            cannot be guaranteed that the content is valid to a particular grammar, 
            or that the processor will recognise all of the elements and attributes 
            in the document — in fact it will likely not recognise the payload. Rules
            are defined so that such extended documents are guaranteed to be processed
            in an interoperable manner.
          </p>

          <p>
            REX has a published Test Suite and associated implementation report showing
            which implementations passed which tests at the time of the report. This 
            information is periodically updated as new tests are added or as 
            implementations improve.

    <ul>
      <li>
        miscellaneous fixes to the comments, as reported by 
        <a href='http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webapi/2006Feb/0001.html'>Fabrice Desré (France Telecom R&amp;D)</a>,
        and <a href='http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webapi/2006Feb/0004.html'>Elliotte Harold (UNC)</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        a number of typos, spotted by
        <a href='http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webapi/2006Feb/0005.html'>Elliotte Harold (UNC)</a>, and 
        <a href='http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webapi/2006Feb/0011.html'>Ruud Steltenpool (University of Twente)</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        attribute version changed to <at>minimal-version</at> based on feedback from Dave Singer.
      </li>
      <li>
        clarified transport independence in the overview (Dave Raggett, Chris Lilley)
      </li>
      <li>
        IRI validation now not recommended, and <code>namespaceURI</code> is defined to be
        its URI equivalent (John Cowan).
      </li>
      <li>
        the processing model no longer contradicts timeStamp processing (Philippe Le Hégaret)
      </li>
      <li>
        changed default <at>ns</at> value as well as event namespaces in accordance with
        DOM 3 Events changes. Also substituted URI and IRI in some places.
      </li>
      <li>
        all the parts that have to do with streaming are now in a separate module
      </li>
      <li>
        clearly indicate that the events are to be dispatched in document order when they
        are not timed (Dave Singer)
      </li>
      <li>
        added the ability to specify a target document, if multiple documents are present
      </li>
      <li>
        modified the XPath matching rules such that they only ever return a single
        node (text or element, attributes are no longer needed). It is expected that a
        future version of this specification will add a flag indicating that multiple
        nodes can be matched.
      </li>
      <li>
        DOMAttrModified no longer targets attributes directly from the target path, but
        rather targets the owner element and has an additional <at el='DOMAttrModified'>attrName</at>
        attribute to specify which is the targeted attribute. Without this implementations
        could not directly reused an external XPath implementation but rather had to perform
        at least some parsing of the target path themselves (David Rivron).
      </li>
      <li>
        clarified that text is not normalised in any particular way (David Rivron).
