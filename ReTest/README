To use ReTest, you will need to have the following software packages installed:

1) Perl - this should already be installed on most operating systems. For
   Windows you can get it from http://activestate.com/.

Then, you need to build and install ReSpec itself:

perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
# optional, as superuser:
make install

Now you should be able to run it as 'retest SRCDIR PUBLISHDIR' and it
will use the source files in SRCDIR to generate final tests into
PUBLISHDIR.
