<h2 class="no-num no-toc" id="toc">Table of Contents</h2>
<!--toc-->

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>The <code title="dfn-TCPSocket">TCPSocket</code> interface enables
a TCP connection from the client to the server from which the script was
downloaded and executed from. Instances of this object can be made using a
constructor on the <code>Window</code> object. </p>

<p class="note">  This interface does not allow for raw access to the
underlying network. For example, this interface could not be used to
implement an IRC client without proxying messages through a custom server.
</p>

<p class="issue">Add an introduction to the client-side and server-side of
using the direct connection APIs. The example below could be better. </p>

<div class="example">
<p>Provide an example here</p>
<pre>  var con = null;
  try { 
    con = new TCPSocket("www.example.com, "12345");
  }
  catch (ex) { 
    if ("SECURITY_ERR" == ex.message) { 
      alert("unable to connect") 
    } 
  }
  
  con.addEventListener("socketdata", function(ev) {
    if ("pong" == ev.data) { alert("Success"); }
    else { alert("Failure"); }
  }
  
  con.write("ping");
  con.flush();
 </pre>
</div>

<h2 id="the-connection">The <code>TCPSocket</code> object</h2>

<p><code><a href="#connection0">TCPSocket</a></code> objects must also
implement the <code>EventTarget</code> interface.
[<cite><span>DOM3Events</span></cite>].</p>

<p>In [<cite><span>ECMAScript</span></cite>], an instance of
<code>TCPSocket</code> can be created using the
<code>TCPSocket</code> constructor. This is done by calling the
<code>TCPSocket</code> function as part of a new expression like: </p>

<div class="example">
var ircConnection = new TCPSocket("example.com", "6667"); </div>

<h3>The <code>TCPSocket</code> constructor</h3>

<p>When the <code>TCPSocket</code> is called as part of a new expression
in ECMAScript, it returns the newly created TCPSocket object which must
be initialized according to the rules below.</p>
<pre class="idl">out TCPSocket TCPSocket(in DOMString <var>subdomain</var>, in DOMString <var>port</var>); </pre>

<p>The <dfn id="dfn-subdomain"><code>subdomain</code></dfn> argument is
prepended to the script's domain with a dot separating the two strings, and
that is the target host. If <code>null</code> or an empty string the target
host is the scripts domain. </p>

<p class="issue">Should the syntax example.com:12345 be allowed as subdomain argument? </p>

<!-- <p>The <dfn id="dfn-port"><code>port</code></dfn> argument is the target
port. The port argument must not be equal to 80, nor equal to 443, nor
greater than or equal to 1024 and less than or equal to 65535. In such case
an <code>SECURITY_ERR</code> exception must be thrown.</p>
-->

<h3>Members of the <code>TCPSocket</code> object</h3>
<pre class="idl">interface <dfn id="connection0">TCPSocket</dfn> {
  readonly attribute DOMString     <span title="dfn-peer">peer</span>;
           attribute EventListener <span title="dfn-onsocketdata">socketdata</span>;
           attribute EventListener <span title="dfn-onconnect">onconnect</span>;
           attribute EventListener <span title="dfn-onclose">onclose</span>;
                     DOMString     <span title="dfn-read">read</span>();
                     void          <span title="dfn-send">write</span>(in DOMString <var>data</var>);
                     void          <span title="dfn-send">flush</span>();
                     void          <span title="dfn-close">close</span>();
};</pre>

<p>The <dfn id="peer" title="dfn-peer"><code>peer</code></dfn> attribute
identifies the remote host for direct (non-broadcast) connections. The
<code>peer</code> attribute must initially be set to the empty string and
must be updated once, when the connection is established, after which point
it must keep the same value for the lifetime of the object. </p>

<p id="openConnection">Once a connection is established the <code
title="dfn-event-connect">connect</code> event must be fired on the
<code>TCPSocket</code> object. </p>

<p>When data is received, the <code
title="dfn-event-socketdata">socketdata</code> event
will be fired on the <code>TCPSocket</code>.
</p>

<p class="issue">Should define further when the socketdata event should fire</p>

<p id="closeConnection">When the connection is closed, the <code
title="dfn-event-close">close</code> event must be fired on the
<code>TCPSocket</code> object. </p>

<p>The <dfn id="onopen" title="dfn-onopen"><code>onopen</code></dfn>, <dfn
id="onsocketdata" title="dfn-onsocketdata"><code>onsocketdata</code></dfn>, and <dfn
id="onclose" title="dfn-onclose"><code>onclose</code></dfn> attributes must,
when set, register their new value as an event listener for their respective
events (namely <code title="dfn-event-open">open</code>, <code
title="dfn-event-socketdata">socketdata</code>, <code
title="dfn-event-close">close</code>), and unregister their previous value if
any. </p>

<p>The <dfn id="read" title="dfn-read"><code>read()</code></dfn> method reads a
<code>DOMString</code> from the <code>TCPSocket</code>. It's assumed that the
<code>DOMString</code> is prefixed with an unsigned short integer that indicates
the length in bytes. If the connection is not yet established, it
must raise an <code>INVALID_STATE_ERR</code> exception.</p>

<p>The <dfn id="write" title="dfn-write"><code>write(<a
href="#send"><var>data</var></a>)</code></dfn> method queues data on the socket
for writing. If the connection is not yet established, it must raise an
<code>INVALID_STATE_ERR</code> exception. Note that the <code>flush</code>
method must be called before any data is transmitted on the socket.</p>

<p>The <dfn id="flush" title="dfn-flush"><code>flush()</code></dfn> method
transmits data using the connection. If the connection is not yet established,
it must raise an <code>INVALID_STATE_ERR</code> exception. If the connection <em>is</em>
established, then the behavior depends on the connection type, as described
below. </p>

<p>The <dfn id="close"><code>close()</code></dfn> method must close the
connection, if it is open. If the connection is already closed, it must
do nothing. Closing the connection causes a <code>close</code> event to be
fired.

<h2 id="connectionEvents">TCPSocket Events</h2>

<p>All the events described in this section are events in the <code>null</code>
namespace, which do not bubble, are not cancelable, and have no default action.
</p>

<p>The <dfn id="event-open" title="dfn-event-open"><code>open</code></dfn> event is
fired when the connection is established. UAs must use the normal
<code>Event</code> interface when firing this event. </p>

<p>The <dfn id="event-close" title="dfn-event-close"><code>close</code></dfn> event
is fired when the connection is closed (whether by the author, calling the
<code>disconnect()</code> method, or by the server, or by a network error).
UAs must use the normal <code>Event</code> interface when firing this event
as well. </p>

<p>The <dfn id="event-socketdata" title="dfn-event-socketdata"><code>socketdata</code></dfn> event is
fired when when data is received for a connection. UAs must follow the "Progress events 1.0" 
specification [ProgressEvent1.0] for this event. </p>

<pre class="idl">interface <dfn id="progressevent">ProgressEvent</dfn> : events::Event {
     readonly attribute boolean         <span>lengthComputable</span>;
     readonly attribute unsigned long   <span>loaded</span>;
     readonly attribute unsigned long   <span>total</span>;
     void               initProgressEvent(in DOMString <var>typeArg</var>,
                                          in boolean       <var>canBubbleArg</var>,

                                            in unsigned long <var>totalArg</var>);
};</pre>

<p>The variables for the <code>initProgressEvent</code> and
<code>initProgressEventNS</code> functions should by default be set accordingly
to the "Progress events 1.0" specification [ProgressEvent1.0] with the following exceptions:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>lengthComputableArg</code> must be false</li>
  <li><code>totalArg</code> must be 0</li>
</ul>

<p><code>loadedArg</code> must be set to the number of readable bytes loaded
when the event was dispatched. This number must not change while the
EventListeners are processing the event.</p> 

<p>Events that would be fired during script execution (e.g. between the
connection object being created &mdash; and thus the connection being
established &mdash; and the current script completing; or, during the
execution of a <code><a href="#read">read</a></code> event handler) must be
buffered, and those events queued up and each one individually fired after
the script has completed.</p>
<!-- XXX make this more generic -->

<h2>Initializing the <code>TCPSocket</code> object</h2>

<p>When a <code>TCPSocket</code> object is created using this
constructor, the following steps must be performed.</p>

<p>First, a pointer must be stored on the newly created object, called the
<dfn title="Window pointer" id="window-pointer"><code>Window</code>
pointer</dfn>. This <span title="Window pointer">pointer</span> <em
class="ct">must</em> persist even if the browsing context in which the <code
title="">Window</code> is located is destroyed (by removing it from a parent
browsing context, for instance). The term browsing context is defined by the
<cite>Window Object 1.0</cite> specification.
[<cite><span>Window</span></cite>]</p>

<p>Secondly, the user agent must verify that the string
representing the script's hostname is a valid hostname in the IDNA format or an
IP address. If this is not valid a 

<!-- <p>Secondly, if the <span>script's domain</span> is not a host name (e.g. it
is an IP address) then a <code>SECURITY_ERR</code> <em class="ct">should</em>
be raised by the user agent. <span class="issue">We currently don't allow
connections to be set up back to an originating IP address, but we could, if
the subdomain is the empty string.</span></p> -->

<!-- <p>Then, if the <var title="">subdomain</var> argument is null or the empty
string, the target host is the <span>script's domain</span>.</p>
-->

<!-- Otherwise, the
<var title="">subdomain</var> argument is prepended to the <span>script's
domain</span> with a dot separating the two strings, and that is the target
host.</p> -->

<!-- <p>If either:</p>
<ul>
  <li>the target host is not a valid host name, or</li>
  <li>the <var title="">port</var> argument is neither equal to 80, nor equal
    to 443, nor greater than or equal to 1024 and less than or equal to
  65535,</li>
</ul>


<p>...then the UA must raise a <code>SECURITY_ERR</code> exception.</p> -->
<!-- XXX we should have our own port for this too, e.g. 980 -->

<p>Otherwise, the user agent must verify that the <span>the string
representing the script's domain in IDNA format</span> can be obtained
without errors. If it cannot, then the user agent must raise a
<code>NETWORK_ERR</code> exception.</p>

<p>The user agent may also raise a <code>SECURITY_ERR</code> exception at
this time if, for some reason, permission to create a direct TCP connection
to the relevant host is denied. Reasons could include the UA being instructed
by the user to not allow direct connections, or the UA establishing (for
instance using UPnP) that the network topology will cause connections on the
specified port to be directed at the wrong host.</p>

<p>If no exceptions are raised by the previous steps, then a new
<code>TCPSocket</code> object must be created, its <code
title="dfn-peer">peer</code> attribute must be set to a string consisting of
the name of the target host, a colon (U+003A COLON), and the port number as
decimal digits.</p>

<p>This object must then be returned.</p>

<p>The user agent must then begin trying to establish a connection with the
target host and specified port. (This typically would begin in the
background, while the script continues to execute.)</p>

<p>Once the connection is established, the UA must act as described in the
section entitled <span>sending and receiving data over TCP</span>.</p>

<p>User agents should allow multiple TCP connections to be established per
host.</p>
<!-- 
<h2>Communication on the network</h2>

<p>This section describes how connections are established from the client and
server sides, and then describes how data is sent and received over such
connections (which is the same for both clients and servers). </p>

<p class="issue">Should explain procedure if connection is dropped</p>
<p class="issue">Should the specification say anything about virtual domains?</p>

<h3><dfn id="sending1">Sending and receiving data over TCP</dfn></h3>

<p class="issue">Is there anything interesting in this section?</p>

<p>When the <code title="dom-Connection-send"><a href="#send">write(<var
title="">data</var>)</a></code> method is invoked on the connection's
corresponding <code><a href="#connection0">TCPSocket</a></code> object,
the user agent must take the <var title="">data</var> argument, replace any
U+0000 NULL and U+0017 END OF TRANSMISSION BLOCK characters in it with U+FFFD
REPLACEMENT CHARACTER characters, then transmit a U+0002 START OF TEXT
character, this new <var title="">data</var> string and a single U+0017 END
OF TRANSMISSION BLOCK character (in that order) to the remote host, all
encoded as UTF-8. </p>

<p>When the user agent receives bytes on the connection, the user agent must
buffer received bytes until it receives a 0x17 byte (a U+0017 END OF
TRANSMISSION BLOCK character). If the first buffered byte is not a 0x02 byte
(a U+0002 START OF TEXT character encoded as UTF-8) then all the data up to
the 0x17 byte, inclusive, must be dropped. (This allows for future extension
of this protocol.) Otherwise, all the data from (but not including) the 0x02
byte and up to (but not including) the 0x17 byte must be taken, interpreted
as a UTF-8 string, and a <code title="event-connection-read"><a
href="#read">read</a></code> event must be fired on the <code><a
href="#connection0">TCPSocket</a></code> object with that string as the
<code title="dom-ConnectionReadEvent-data"><a href="#data4">data</a></code>.
If that string cannot be decoded as UTF-8 without errors, the packet should
be ignored. </p>

<p class="note">This protocol does not yet allow binary data (e.g. an image
or video data) to be efficiently transmitted. A future version of this
protocol might allow this by using the prefix character U+001F INFORMATION
SEPARATOR ONE, followed by binary data which uses a particular byte (e.g.
0xFF) to encode byte 0x17 somehow (since otherwise 0x17 would be treated as
transmission end by down-level UAs).</p>

Specifically, replace all occurrences of 0xFF with 0xFF 0xFF and
all occurrences of 0x17 with 0xFF 0x00, or similar.

<h2 id="network-security">Security</h2>

<p class="issue">Need to write this section. </p>

<p class="issue">If you have an unencrypted page that is (through a
man-in-the-middle attack) changed, it can access a secure service that is
using IP authentication and then send that data back to the attacker. Ergo we
should probably stop unencrypted pages from accessing encrypted services, on
the principle that the actual level of security is zero. Then again, if we do
that, we prevent insecure sites from using SSL as a tunneling mechanism. </p>

<p class="issue">Should consider dropping the subdomain-only restriction. It
doesn't seem to add anything, and prevents cross-domain chatter. </p>

<h2 id="network-other-specs">Relationship to other standards</h2>

<p class="issue">Should have a section talking about the fact that we
blithely ignoring IANA's port assignments here.</p>

<p class="issue">Should explain why we are not reusing HTTP for this. (HTTP
is too heavy-weight for such a simple need; requiring authors to implement an
HTTP server just to have a party line is too much of a barrier to entry;
cannot rely on prebuilt components; having a simple protocol makes it much
easier to do RAD; HTTP doesn't fit the needs and doesn't have the security
model needed; etc)</p>
