  <h2 id=introduction><span class=secno>1. </span>Introduction</h2>

  <p>The <code title=dfn-TCPConnection>TCPConnection</code> interface enables
   a TCP connection from the client to the server from which the script was
   downloaded and executed from. Instances of this object can be made using a
   constructor on the <code><a href="#ref-window">Window</a></code> object.

  <p class=note>This interface does not allow for raw access to the
   underlying network. For example, this interface could not be used to
   implement an IRC client without proxying messages through a custom server.
   

  <p class=issue>Add an introduction to the client-side and server-side of
   using the direct connection APIs. The example below could be better.

  <div class=example>
   <p>Provide an example here</p>

   <pre>  var con = null;
  try { 
    con = new TCPConnection("", "12345"); 
  }
  catch (ex) { 
    if ("SECURITY_ERR" == ex.message) { 
      alert("unable to connect") 
    } 
  }
  con.onread = function(o) { 
    if ("pong" == o.data) { alert("'success"); } 
    else { alert("unknown data"); }
  }
  con.send("ping"); 
 </pre>
  </div>

  <h2 id=the-connection><span class=secno>2. </span>The <code><a
   href="#connection0">TCPConnection</a></code> object</h2>

  <p><code><a href="#connection0">TCPConnection</a></code> objects must also
   implement the <code>EventTarget</code> interface. [<cite><a
   href="#DOM3EV">DOM3Events</a></cite>].

  <p>In [<cite><a href="#ref-ecmascript">ECMAScript</a></cite>], an instance
   of <code><a href="#connection0">TCPConnection</a></code> can be created
   using the <code><a href="#connection0">TCPConnection</a></code>
   constructor. This is done by calling the <code><a
   href="#connection0">TCPConnection</a></code> function as part of a new
   expression like:

  <div class=example> var ircConnection = new TCPConnection("example.com",
   "6667", true);</div>

  <h3 id=the-tcpconnection><span class=secno>2.1. </span>The <code><a
   href="#connection0">TCPConnection</a></code> constructor</h3>

  <p>When the <code><a href="#connection0">TCPConnection</a></code> is called
   as part of a new expression in ECMAScript, it returns the newly created
   TCPConnection object which must be initialized according to the rules
   below.

  <pre
   class=idl>out TCPConnection TCPConnection(in DOMString <var><a href="#dfn-subdomain">subdomain</a></var>, 
                                in DOMString <var><a href="#dfn-port">port</a></var>, 
                                in Boolean <var><a href="#dfn-secure">secure</a></var>); </pre>

  <p>The <dfn id=dfn-subdomain><code>subdomain</code></dfn> argument is
   prepended to the script's domain with a dot separating the two strings,
   and that is the target host. If <code>null</code> or an empty string the
   target host is the scripts doamin.

  <p>The <dfn id=dfn-port><code>port</code></dfn> argument is the target
   port. The port argument must not be equal to 80, nor equal to 443, nor
   greater than or equal to 1024 and less than or equal to 65535. In such
   case an <code>SECURITY_ERR</code> exception must be thrown.

  <p>If the boolean <dfn id=dfn-secure><code>secure</code></dfn> argument is
   set to <code>true</code>, then the user agent must establish a secure
   connection with the target host and specified port using TLS or another
   protocol, negotiated with the server. [RFC2246] If this fails the user
   agent must act as if it had closed the connection.

  <h3 id=members><span class=secno>2.2. </span>Members of the <code><a
   href="#connection0">TCPConnection</a></code> object</h3>

  <pre class=idl>interface <dfn id=connection0>TCPConnection</dfn> {
  readonly attribute DOMString     <a href="#peer" title=dfn-peer>peer</a>;
  readonly attribute int           <a href="#readystate" title=dfn-readyState>readyState</a>;
           attribute EventListener <a href="#onopen" title=dfn-onopen>onopen</a>;
           attribute EventListener <span title=dfn-onready>onread</span>;
           attribute EventListener <a href="#onclose" title=dfn-onclose>onclose</a>;
                     void          <a href="#send" title=dfn-send>send</a>(in DOMString <var><a href="#data">data</a></var>);
                     void          <span title=dfn-disconnect>disconnect</span>();
};</pre>

  <p>The <dfn id=peer title=dfn-peer><code>peer</code></dfn> attribute
   identifies the remote host for direct (non-broadcast) connections. The
   <code>peer</code> attribute must initially be set to the empty string and
   must be updated once, when the connection is established, after which
   point it must keep the same value for the lifetime of the object.

  <p>The <dfn id=readystate
   title=dfn-readyState><code>readyState</code></dfn> attribute represents
   the state of the connection. When the object is created it must be set to
   0. It can have the following values:

  <dl>
   <dt>0 Connecting

   <dd>The connection has not yet been established.

   <dt>1 Connected

   <dd>The connection is established and communication is possible.

   <dt>2 Closed

   <dd>The connection has been closed.
  </dl>

  <p id=openConnection>Once a connection is established, the
   <code>readyState</code> attribute's value must be changed to 1, and the
   <code title=dfn-event-open><a href="#open">open</a></code> event must be
   fired on the <code><a href="#connection0">TCPConnection</a></code> object.
   

  <p>When data is received, the <code title=dfn-event-read><a
   href="#read">read</a></code> event will be fired on the <code><a
   href="#connection0">TCPConnection</a></code>. <span class=note>Should
   provide an example of binary protocol. E.g. read from NTP</span>

  <p id=closeConnection>When the connection is closed, the
   <code>readyState</code> attribute's value must be changed to 2, and the
   <code title=dfn-event-close><a href="#close">close</a></code> event must
   be fired on the <code><a href="#connection0">TCPConnection</a></code>
   object.

  <p>The <dfn id=onopen title=dfn-onopen><code>onopen</code></dfn>, <dfn
   id=onread title=dfn-onread><code>onread</code></dfn>, and <dfn id=onclose
   title=dfn-onclose><code>onclose</code></dfn> attributes must, when set,
   register their new value as an event listener for their respective events
   (namely <code title=dfn-event-open><a href="#open">open</a></code>, <code
   title=dfn-event-read><a href="#read">read</a></code>, <code
   title=dfn-event-close><a href="#close">close</a></code>), and unregister
   their previous value if any.

  <p>The <dfn id=send title=dfn-send><code>send(<a
   href="#send"><var>data</var></a>)</code></dfn> method transmits data using
   the connection. If the connection is not yet established, it must raise an
   <code>INVALID_STATE_ERR</code> exception. If the connection <em>is</em>
   established, then the behavior depends on the connection type, as
   described below.

  <p>The <dfn id=disconnect><code>disconnect()</code></dfn> method must close
   the connection, if it is open. If the connection is already closed, it
   must do nothing. Closing the connection causes a <code>close</code> event
   to be fired and the <code>readyState</code> attribute's value to change,
   as <a href="#closeConnection">described above</a>.

  <h2 id=connectionEvents><span class=secno>3. </span>TCPConnection Events</h2>

  <p>All the events described in this section are events in no namespace,
   which do not bubble, are not cancelable, and have no default action.

  <p>The <dfn id=open title=dfn-event-open><code>open</code></dfn> event is
   fired when the connection is established. UAs must use the normal
   <code>Event</code> interface when firing this event.

  <p>The <dfn id=close title=dfn-event-close><code>close</code></dfn> event
   is fired when the connection is closed (whether by the author, calling the
   <code><a href="#disconnect">disconnect()</a></code> method, or by the
   server, or by a network error). UAs must use the normal <code>Event</code>
   interface when firing this event as well.

  <p class=note>No information regarding why the connection was closed is
   passed to the application in this version of this specification.

  <p>The <dfn id=read title=dfn-event-read><code>read</code></dfn> event is
   fired when when data is received for a connection. UAs must use the
   <code><a href="#connectionreadevent">ConnectionReadEvent</a></code>
   interface for this event.

  <pre
   class=idl>interface <dfn id=connectionreadevent>ConnectionReadEvent</dfn> : Event {
readonly attribute DOMString <a href="#data">data</a>;
  void initConnectionReadEvent(in DOMString <var>typeArg</var>, 
                                 in boolean <var>canBubbleArg</var>, 
                                 in boolean <var>cancelableArg</var>, 
                                 in DOMString <var>dataArg</var>);
  void initConnectionReadEventNS(in DOMString namespaceURI, 
                                   in DOMString typeArg, 
                                   in boolean canBubbleArg, 
                                   in boolean cancelableArg, 
                                   in DOMString dataArg);
};</pre>

  <p>The <dfn id=data><code>data</code></dfn> attribute must contain the data
   that was transmitted from the peer.

  <p>The <dfn id=initconnectionreadevent>initConnectionReadEvent()</dfn> and
   <dfn id=initconnectionreadeventns>initConnectionReadEventNS()</dfn>
   methods must initialize the event in a manner analogous to the
   similarly-named methods in the DOM3 Events interfaces. <a
   href="#DOM3Events">[DOM3EVENTS]</a>

  <p>Events that would be fired during script execution (e.g. between the
   connection object being created &mdash; and thus the connection being
   established &mdash; and the current script completing; or, during the
   execution of a <code><a href="#read">read</a></code> event handler) must
   be buffered, and those events queued up and each one individually fired
   after the script has completed.</p>
  <!-- XXX make this more generic -->

  <h2 id=initializing><span class=secno>4. </span>Initializing the <code><a
   href="#connection0">TCPConnection</a></code> object</h2>

  <p>When a <code><a href="#connection0">TCPConnection</a></code> object is
   created using this constructor, the following steps must be followed.

  <p>First, a pointer must be stored on the newly created object, called the
   <dfn id=window-pointer title="Window pointer"><code>Window</code>
   pointer</dfn>. This <a href="#window-pointer" title="Window
   pointer">pointer</a> <em class=ct>must</em> persist even if the browsing
   context in which the <code title="">Window</code> is located is destroyed
   (by removing it from a parent browsing context, for instance). The term
   browsing context is defined by the <cite>Window Object 1.0</cite>
   specification. [<cite><a href="#ref-window">Window</a></cite>]

  <p>Secondly, if the <span>script's domain</span> is not a host name (e.g.
   it is an IP address) then a <code>SECURITY_ERR</code> <em
   class=ct>should</em> be raised by the user agent. <span class=issue>We
   currently don't allow connections to be set up back to an originating IP
   address, but we could, if the subdomain is the empty string.</span>

  <p>Then, if the <var title="">subdomain</var> argument is null or the empty
   string, the target host is the <span>script's domain</span>. Otherwise,
   the <var title="">subdomain</var> argument is prepended to the
   <span>script's domain</span> with a dot separating the two strings, and
   that is the target host.

  <p>If either:

  <ul>
   <li>the target host is not a valid host name, or

   <li>the <var title="">port</var> argument is neither equal to 80, nor
    equal to 443, nor greater than or equal to 1024 and less than or equal to
    65535,
  </ul>

  <p>...then the UA must raise a <code>SECURITY_ERR</code> exception.</p>
  <!-- XXX we should have our own port for this too, e.g. 980 -->

  <p>Otherwise, the user agent must verify that the <span>the string
   representing the script's domain in IDNA format</span> can be obtained
   without errors. If it cannot, then the user agent must raise a
   <code>SECURITY_ERR</code> exception.

  <p>The user agent may also raise a <code>SECURITY_ERR</code> exception at
   this time if, for some reason, permission to create a direct TCP
   connection to the relevant host is denied. Reasons could include the UA
   being instructed by the user to not allow direct connections, or the UA
   establishing (for instance using UPnP) that the network topology will
   cause connections on the specified port to be directed at the wrong host.

  <p>If no exceptions are raised by the previous steps, then a new <code><a
   href="#connection0">TCPConnection</a></code> object must be created, its
   <code title=dfn-peer><a href="#peer">peer</a></code> attribute must be set
   to a string consisting of the name of the target host, a colon (U+003A
   COLON), and the port number as decimal digits.

  <p>This object must then be returned.

  <p>The user agent must then begin trying to establish a connection with the
   target host and specified port. (This typically would begin in the
   background, while the script continues to execute.)

  <p>If the <var title="">secure</var> boolean argument is set to true, then
   the user agent must establish a secure connection with the target host and
   specified port using TLS or another protocol, negotiated with the server.
   [<cite><span>RFC2246</span></cite>] If this fails the user agent must act
   as if it had <a href="#closeConnection">closed the connection</a>.

  <p>Once a secure connection is established, or if the <var
   title="">secure</var> boolean argument is not set to true, then the user
   agent must continue to connect to the server using the protocol described
   in the section entitled <a href="#clients1">clients connecting over
   TCP</a>. All data on connections made using TLS must be sent as
   "application data".

  <p>Once the connection is established, the UA must act as described in the
   section entitled <a href="#sending1">sending and receiving data over
   TCP</a>.

  <p>User agents should allow multiple TCP connections to be established per
   host. In particular, user agents should not apply per-host HTTP connection
   limits to connections established with the <code
   title=dom-TCPConnection>TCPConnection</code> constructor.

  <h2 id=communication><span class=secno>5. </span>Communication on the
   network</h2>

  <p>This section describes how connections are established from the client
   and server sides, and then describes how data is sent and received over
   such connections (which is the same for both clients and servers).

  <h3 id=clients><span class=secno>5.1. </span><dfn id=clients1>Clients
   connecting over TCP</dfn></h3>

  <p>This section defines the client-side requirements of the protocol used
   by the <code title=dom-TCPConnection><a
   href="#tcpconnection">TCPConnection</a></code>.

  <p>If a TCP connection to the specified target host and port cannot be
   established, for example because the target host is a domain name that
   cannot be resolved to an IP address, or because packets cannot be routed
   to the host, the user agent should retry creating the connection. If the
   user agent gives up trying to connect, the user agent must act as if it
   had <a href="#closeConnection">closed the connection</a>.

  <p class=note>No information regarding the state of the connection is
   passed to the application while the connection is being established in
   this version of this specification.

  <p>Once a TCP/IP connection to the remote host is established, the user
   agent must transmit the following sequence of bytes, represented here in
   hexadecimal form:

  <pre>0x48 0x65 0x6C 0x6C 0x6F 0x0A</pre>

  <p class=note>This represents the string "Hello" followed by a newline,
   encoded in UTF-8.

  <p>The user agent must then read all the bytes sent from the remote host,
   up to the first 0x0A byte (inclusive). That string of bytes is then
   compared byte-for-byte to the following string of bytes:

  <pre>0x57 0x65 0x6C 0x63 0x6F 0x6E 0x65 0x0A</pre>

  <p class=note>This says "Welcome".

  <p>If the server sent back a string in any way different to this, then the
   user agent must <a href="#closeConnection">close the connection</a> and
   give up trying to connect.

  <p>Otherwise, the user agent must then take <a href="#the-string">the
   string representing the script's domain in IDNA format</a>, encode it as
   UTF-8, and send that to the remote host, followed by a 0x0A byte (a U+000A
   LINE FEED in UTF-8).

  <p>The user agent must then read all the bytes sent from the remote host,
   up to the first 0x0A byte (inclusive). That string of bytes must then be
   compared byte-for-byte to the string that was just sent to the server (the
   one with the IDNA domain name and ending with a newline character). If the
   server sent back a string in any way different to this, then the user
   agent must <a href="#closeConnection">close the connection</a> and give up
   trying to connect.

  <p>Otherwise, the connection <a href="#openConnection">has been
   established</a> (and events and so forth get fired, as described above).

   accepting connections over TCP</dfn></h3>

  <p>This section defines the server side of the protocol described in the
   previous section. For authors, it should be used as a guide for how to
   implement servers that can communicate with Web pages over TCP.

  <p>Once a TCP/IP connection from a remote host is established, the user
   agent must transmit the following sequence of bytes, represented here in
   hexadecimal form:

  <pre>0x57 0x65 0x6C 0x63 0x6F 0x6E 0x65 0x0A</pre>

  <p class=note>This says "Welcome" and a newline in UTF-8.

  <p>The user agent must then read all the bytes sent from the remote host,
   up to the first 0x0A byte (inclusive). That string of bytes is then
   compared byte-for-byte to the following string of bytes:

  <pre>0x48 0x65 0x6C 0x6C 0x6F 0x0A</pre>

  <p class=note>"Hello" and a newline.

  <p>If the remote host sent back a string in any way different to this, then
   the user agent must <a href="#closeConnection">close the connection</a>
   and give up trying to connect.

  <p>Otherwise, the user agent must then take <a href="#the-string">the
   string representing the script's domain in IDNA format</a>, encode it as
   UTF-8, and send that to the remote host, followed by a 0x0A byte (a U+000A
   LINE FEED in UTF-8).

  <p>The user agent must then read all the bytes sent from the remote host,
   up to the first 0x0A byte (inclusive). That string of bytes must then be
   compared byte-for-byte to the string that was just sent to that host (the
   one with the IDNA domain name and ending with a newline character). If the
   remote host sent back a string in any way different to this, then the user
   agent must <a href="#closeConnection">close the connection</a> and give up
   trying to connect.

  <p>Otherwise, the connection <a href="#openConnection">has been
   established</a> (and events and so forth get fired, as described above).

  <p class=note>For author-written servers (as opposed to the server side of
   a peer-to-peer connection), the script's domain would be replaced by the
   hostname of the server. Alternatively, such servers might instead wait for
   the client to send its domain string, and then simply echo it back. This
   would allow connections from pages on any domain, instead of just pages
   originating from the same host. The client compares the two strings to
   ensure they are the same before allowing the connection to be used by
   author script.

  <p>If at any point during this process the connection is closed
   prematurely, then the user agent must <a href="#closeConnection">close the
   connection</a> and give up trying to connect.</p>
  <!-- XXX we should support automatic reconnect -->

  <h3 id=sending><span class=secno>5.3. </span><dfn id=sending1>Sending and
   receiving data over TCP</dfn></h3>

  <p>When the <code title=dom-Connection-send><a href="#send">send(<var
   title="">data</var>)</a></code> method is invoked on the connection's
   corresponding <code><a href="#connection0">TCPConnection</a></code>
   object, the user agent must take the <var title="">data</var> argument,
   replace any U+0000 NULL and U+0017 END OF TRANSMISSION BLOCK characters in
   it with U+FFFD REPLACEMENT CHARACTER characters, then transmit a U+0002
   START OF TEXT character, this new <var title="">data</var> string and a
   single U+0017 END OF TRANSMISSION BLOCK character (in that order) to the
   remote host, all encoded as UTF-8.

  <p>When the user agent receives bytes on the connection, the user agent
   must buffer received bytes until it receives a 0x17 byte (a U+0017 END OF
   TRANSMISSION BLOCK character). If the first buffered byte is not a 0x02
   byte (a U+0002 START OF TEXT character encoded as UTF-8) then all the data
   up to the 0x17 byte, inclusive, must be dropped. (This allows for future
   extension of this protocol.) Otherwise, all the data from (but not
   including) the 0x02 byte and up to (but not including) the 0x17 byte must
   be taken, interpreted as a UTF-8 string, and a <code
   title=event-connection-read><a href="#read">read</a></code> event must be
   fired on the <code><a href="#connection0">TCPConnection</a></code> object
   with that string as the <code title=dom-ConnectionReadEvent-data><a
   href="#data4">data</a></code>. If that string cannot be decoded as UTF-8
   without errors, the packet should be ignored.

  <p class=note>This protocol does not yet allow binary data (e.g. an image
   or video data) to be efficiently transmitted. A future version of this
   protocol might allow this by using the prefix character U+001F INFORMATION
   SEPARATOR ONE, followed by binary data which uses a particular byte (e.g.
   0xFF) to encode byte 0x17 somehow (since otherwise 0x17 would be treated
   as transmission end by down-level UAs).</p>
  <!--
Specifically, replace all occurrences of 0xFF with 0xFF 0xFF and
all occurrences of 0x17 with 0xFF 0x00, or similar.

  <h2 id=network-security><span class=secno>6. </span>Security</h2>

  <p class=issue>Need to write this section.

  <p class=issue>If you have an unencrypted page that is (through a
   man-in-the-middle attack) changed, it can access a secure service that is
   using IP authentication and then send that data back to the attacker. Ergo
   we should probably stop unencrypted pages from accessing encrypted
   services, on the principle that the actual level of security is zero. Then
   again, if we do that, we prevent insecure sites from using SSL as a
   tunneling mechanism.

  <p class=issue>Should consider dropping the subdomain-only restriction. It
   doesn't seem to add anything, and prevents cross-domain chatter.

  <h2 id=network-other-specs><span class=secno>7. </span>Relationship to
   other standards</h2>

  <p class=issue>Should have a section talking about the fact that we
   blithely ignoring IANA's port assignments here.

  <p class=issue>Should explain why we are not reusing HTTP for this. (HTTP
   is too heavy-weight for such a simple need; requiring authors to implement
   an HTTP server just to have a party line is too much of a barrier to
   entry; cannot rely on prebuilt components; having a simple protocol makes
   it much easier to do RAD; HTTP doesn't fit the needs and doesn't have the
   security model needed; etc)
