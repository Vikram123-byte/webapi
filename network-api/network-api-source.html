<h2 class="no-num no-toc" id="toc">Table of Contents</h2>
<!--toc-->

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>The <code title="dfn-TCPConnection">TCPConnection</code> interface enables
a TCP connection from the client to the server from which the script was
downloaded and executed from. Instances of this object can be made using a
constructor on the <code>Window</code> object. </p>

<p class="note">This interface does not allow for raw access to the
underlying network. For example, this interface could not be used to
implement an IRC client without proxying messages through a custom server.
</p>

<p class="issue">Add an introduction to the client-side and server-side of
using the direct connection APIs. The example below could be better. </p>

<div class="example">
<p>Provide an example here</p>
<pre>  var con = null;
  try { 
    con = new TCPConnection("", "12345"); 
  }
  catch (ex) { 
    if ("SECURITY_ERR" == ex.message) { 
      alert("unable to connect") 
    } 
  }
  con.onread = function(o) { 
    if ("pong" == o.data) { alert("'success"); } 
    else { alert("unknown data"); }
  }
  con.send("ping"); 
 </pre>
</div>

<h2 id="the-connection">The <code>TCPConnection</code> object</h2>

<p><code><a href="#connection0">TCPConnection</a></code> objects must also
implement the <code>EventTarget</code> interface.
[<cite><span>DOM3Events</span></cite>].</p>

<p>In [<cite><span>ECMAScript</span></cite>], an instance of
<code>TCPConnection</code> can be created using the
<code>TCPConnection</code> constructor. This is done by calling the
<code>TCPConnection</code> function as part of a new expression like: </p>

<div class="example">
var ircConnection = new TCPConnection("example.com", "6667", true); </div>

<h3>The <code>TCPConnection</code> constructor</h3>

<p>When the <code>TCPConnection</code> is called as part of a new expression
in ECMAScript, it returns the newly created TCPConnection object which must
be initialized according to the rules below.</p>
<pre class="idl">out TCPConnection TCPConnection(in DOMString <var>subdomain</var>, 
                                in DOMString <var>port</var>, 
                                in Boolean <var>secure</var>); </pre>

<p>The <dfn id="dfn-subdomain"><code>subdomain</code></dfn> argument is
prepended to the script's domain with a dot separating the two strings, and
that is the target host. If <code>null</code> or an empty string the target
host is the scripts doamin. </p>

<p>The <dfn id="dfn-port"><code>port</code></dfn> argument is the target
port. The port argument must not be equal to 80, nor equal to 443, nor
greater than or equal to 1024 and less than or equal to 65535. In such case
an <code>SECURITY_ERR</code> exception must be thrown.</p>

<p>If the boolean <dfn id="dfn-secure"><code>secure</code></dfn> argument is
set to <code>true</code>, then the user agent must establish a secure
connection with the target host and specified port using TLS or another
protocol, negotiated with the server. [RFC2246] If this fails the user agent
must act as if it had closed the connection.</p>

<h3>Members of the <code>TCPConnection</code> object</h3>
<pre class="idl">interface <dfn id="connection0">TCPConnection</dfn> {
  readonly attribute DOMString     <span title="dfn-peer">peer</span>;
  readonly attribute int           <span title="dfn-readyState">readyState</span>;
           attribute EventListener <span title="dfn-onopen">onopen</span>;
           attribute EventListener <span title="dfn-onready">onread</span>;
           attribute EventListener <span title="dfn-onclose">onclose</span>;
                     void          <span title="dfn-send">send</span>(in DOMString <var>data</var>);
                     void          <span title="dfn-disconnect">disconnect</span>();
};</pre>

<p>The <dfn id="peer" title="dfn-peer"><code>peer</code></dfn> attribute
identifies the remote host for direct (non-broadcast) connections. The
<code>peer</code> attribute must initially be set to the empty string and
must be updated once, when the connection is established, after which point
it must keep the same value for the lifetime of the object. </p>

<p>The <dfn id="readystate"
title="dfn-readyState"><code>readyState</code></dfn> attribute represents the
state of the connection. When the object is created it must be set to 0. It
can have the following values: </p>
<dl>
  <dt>0 Connecting </dt>
    <dd>The connection has not yet been established. </dd>
  <dt>1 Connected </dt>
    <dd>The connection is established and communication is possible. </dd>
  <dt>2 Closed </dt>
    <dd>The connection has been closed. </dd>
</dl>

<p id="openConnection">Once a connection is established, the
<code>readyState</code> attribute's value must be changed to 1, and the <code
title="dfn-event-open">open</code> event must be fired on the
<code>TCPConnection</code> object. </p>

<p>When data is received, the <code title="dfn-event-read">read</code> event
will be fired on the <code>TCPConnection</code>. <span class="note">Should
provide an example of binary protocol. E.g. read from NTP</span></p>

<p id="closeConnection">When the connection is closed, the
<code>readyState</code> attribute's value must be changed to 2, and the <code
title="dfn-event-close">close</code> event must be fired on the
<code>TCPConnection</code> object. </p>

<p>The <dfn id="onopen" title="dfn-onopen"><code>onopen</code></dfn>, <dfn
id="onread" title="dfn-onread"><code>onread</code></dfn>, and <dfn
id="onclose" title="dfn-onclose"><code>onclose</code></dfn> attributes must,
when set, register their new value as an event listener for their respective
events (namely <code title="dfn-event-open">open</code>, <code
title="dfn-event-read">read</code>, <code
title="dfn-event-close">close</code>), and unregister their previous value if
any. </p>

<p>The <dfn id="send" title="dfn-send"><code>send(<a
href="#send"><var>data</var></a>)</code></dfn> method transmits data using
the connection. If the connection is not yet established, it must raise an
<code>INVALID_STATE_ERR</code> exception. If the connection <em>is</em>
established, then the behavior depends on the connection type, as described
below. </p>

<p>The <dfn id="disconnect"><code>disconnect()</code></dfn> method must close
the connection, if it is open. If the connection is already closed, it must
do nothing. Closing the connection causes a <code>close</code> event to be
fired and the <code>readyState</code> attribute's value to change, as <a
href="#closeConnection">described above</a>.</p>

<h2 id="connectionEvents">TCPConnection Events</h2>

<p>All the events described in this section are events in no namespace, which
do not bubble, are not cancelable, and have no default action. </p>

<p>The <dfn id="open" title="dfn-event-open"><code>open</code></dfn> event is
fired when the connection is established. UAs must use the normal
<code>Event</code> interface when firing this event. </p>

<p>The <dfn id="close" title="dfn-event-close"><code>close</code></dfn> event
is fired when the connection is closed (whether by the author, calling the
<code>disconnect()</code> method, or by the server, or by a network error).
UAs must use the normal <code>Event</code> interface when firing this event
as well. </p>

<p class="note">No information regarding why the connection was closed is
passed to the application in this version of this specification. </p>

<p>The <dfn id="read" title="dfn-event-read"><code>read</code></dfn> event is
fired when when data is received for a connection. UAs must use the
<code>ConnectionReadEvent</code> interface for this event. </p>
<pre class="idl">interface <dfn id="connectionreadevent">ConnectionReadEvent</dfn> : Event {
readonly attribute DOMString <span>data</span>;
  void initConnectionReadEvent(in DOMString <var>typeArg</var>, 
                                 in boolean <var>canBubbleArg</var>, 
                                 in boolean <var>cancelableArg</var>, 
                                 in DOMString <var>dataArg</var>);
  void initConnectionReadEventNS(in DOMString namespaceURI, 
                                   in DOMString typeArg, 
                                   in boolean canBubbleArg, 
                                   in boolean cancelableArg, 
                                   in DOMString dataArg);
};</pre>

<p>The <dfn id="data"><code>data</code></dfn> attribute must contain the data
that was transmitted from the peer. </p>

<p>The <dfn id="initconnectionreadevent">initConnectionReadEvent()</dfn> and
<dfn id="initconnectionreadeventns">initConnectionReadEventNS()</dfn> methods
must initialize the event in a manner analogous to the similarly-named
methods in the DOM3 Events interfaces. <a href="#DOM3Events">[DOM3EVENTS]</a>
</p>

<p>Events that would be fired during script execution (e.g. between the
connection object being created &mdash; and thus the connection being
established &mdash; and the current script completing; or, during the
execution of a <code><a href="#read">read</a></code> event handler) must be
buffered, and those events queued up and each one individually fired after
the script has completed.</p>
<!-- XXX make this more generic -->

<h2>Initializing the <code>TCPConnection</code> object</h2>

<p>When a <code>TCPConnection</code> object is created using this
constructor, the following steps must be followed.</p>

<p>First, a pointer must be stored on the newly created object, called the
<dfn title="Window pointer" id="window-pointer"><code>Window</code>
pointer</dfn>. This <span title="Window pointer">pointer</span> <em
class="ct">must</em> persist even if the browsing context in which the <code
title="">Window</code> is located is destroyed (by removing it from a parent
browsing context, for instance). The term browsing context is defined by the
<cite>Window Object 1.0</cite> specification.
[<cite><span>Window</span></cite>]</p>

<p>Secondly, if the <span>script's domain</span> is not a host name (e.g. it
is an IP address) then a <code>SECURITY_ERR</code> <em class="ct">should</em>
be raised by the user agent. <span class="issue">We currently don't allow
connections to be set up back to an originating IP address, but we could, if
the subdomain is the empty string.</span></p>

<p>Then, if the <var title="">subdomain</var> argument is null or the empty
string, the target host is the <span>script's domain</span>. Otherwise, the
<var title="">subdomain</var> argument is prepended to the <span>script's
domain</span> with a dot separating the two strings, and that is the target
host.</p>

<p>If either:</p>
<ul>
  <li>the target host is not a valid host name, or</li>
  <li>the <var title="">port</var> argument is neither equal to 80, nor equal
    to 443, nor greater than or equal to 1024 and less than or equal to
  65535,</li>
</ul>

<p>...then the UA must raise a <code>SECURITY_ERR</code> exception.</p>
<!-- XXX we should have our own port for this too, e.g. 980 -->

<p>Otherwise, the user agent must verify that the <span>the string
representing the script's domain in IDNA format</span> can be obtained
without errors. If it cannot, then the user agent must raise a
<code>SECURITY_ERR</code> exception.</p>

<p>The user agent may also raise a <code>SECURITY_ERR</code> exception at
this time if, for some reason, permission to create a direct TCP connection
to the relevant host is denied. Reasons could include the UA being instructed
by the user to not allow direct connections, or the UA establishing (for
instance using UPnP) that the network topology will cause connections on the
specified port to be directed at the wrong host.</p>

<p>If no exceptions are raised by the previous steps, then a new
<code>TCPConnection</code> object must be created, its <code
title="dfn-peer">peer</code> attribute must be set to a string consisting of
the name of the target host, a colon (U+003A COLON), and the port number as
decimal digits.</p>

<p>This object must then be returned.</p>

<p>The user agent must then begin trying to establish a connection with the
target host and specified port. (This typically would begin in the
background, while the script continues to execute.)</p>

<p>If the <var title="">secure</var> boolean argument is set to true, then
the user agent must establish a secure connection with the target host and
specified port using TLS or another protocol, negotiated with the server.
[<cite><span>RFC2246</span></cite>] If this fails the user agent must act as
if it had <a href="#closeConnection">closed the connection</a>.</p>

<p>Once a secure connection is established, or if the <var
title="">secure</var> boolean argument is not set to true, then the user
agent must continue to connect to the server using the protocol described in
the section entitled <span>clients connecting over TCP</span>. All data on
connections made using TLS must be sent as "application data".</p>

<p>Once the connection is established, the UA must act as described in the
section entitled <span>sending and receiving data over TCP</span>.</p>

<p>User agents should allow multiple TCP connections to be established per
host. In particular, user agents should not apply per-host HTTP connection
limits to connections established with the <code
title="dom-TCPConnection">TCPConnection</code> constructor.</p>

<h2>Communication on the network</h2>

<p>This section describes how connections are established from the client and
server sides, and then describes how data is sent and received over such
connections (which is the same for both clients and servers). </p>

<h3 id="clients"><dfn id="clients1">Clients connecting over TCP</dfn></h3>

<p>This section defines the client-side requirements of the protocol used by
the <code title="dom-TCPConnection"><a
href="#tcpconnection">TCPConnection</a></code>. </p>

<p>If a TCP connection to the specified target host and port cannot be
established, for example because the target host is a domain name that cannot
be resolved to an IP address, or because packets cannot be routed to the
host, the user agent should retry creating the connection. If the user agent
gives up trying to connect, the user agent must act as if it had <a
href="#closeConnection">closed the connection</a>. </p>

<p class="note">No information regarding the state of the connection is
passed to the application while the connection is being established in this
version of this specification. </p>

<p>Once a TCP/IP connection to the remote host is established, the user agent
must transmit the following sequence of bytes, represented here in
hexadecimal form: </p>
<pre>0x48 0x65 0x6C 0x6C 0x6F 0x0A</pre>

<p class="note">This represents the string "Hello" followed by a newline,
encoded in UTF-8. </p>

<p>The user agent must then read all the bytes sent from the remote host, up
to the first 0x0A byte (inclusive). That string of bytes is then compared
byte-for-byte to the following string of bytes: </p>
<pre>0x57 0x65 0x6C 0x63 0x6F 0x6E 0x65 0x0A</pre>

<p class="note">This says "Welcome". </p>

<p>If the server sent back a string in any way different to this, then the
user agent must <a href="#closeConnection">close the connection</a> and give
up trying to connect. </p>

<p>Otherwise, the user agent must then take <a href="#the-string">the string
representing the script's domain in IDNA format</a>, encode it as UTF-8, and
send that to the remote host, followed by a 0x0A byte (a U+000A LINE FEED in
UTF-8). </p>

<p>The user agent must then read all the bytes sent from the remote host, up
to the first 0x0A byte (inclusive). That string of bytes must then be
compared byte-for-byte to the string that was just sent to the server (the
one with the IDNA domain name and ending with a newline character). If the
server sent back a string in any way different to this, then the user agent
must <a href="#closeConnection">close the connection</a> and give up trying
to connect. </p>

<p>Otherwise, the connection <a href="#openConnection">has been
established</a> (and events and so forth get fired, as described above). </p>

<p>If at any point during this process the connection is closed prematurely,
then the user agent must <a href="#closeConnection">close the connection</a>
and give up trying to connect.</p>
<!-- XXX we should support automatic reconnect -->

<h3 id="servers"><dfn id="servers1">Servers accepting connections over
TCP</dfn></h3>

<p>This section defines the server side of the protocol described in the
previous section. For authors, it should be used as a guide for how to
implement servers that can communicate with Web pages over TCP. </p>

<p>Once a TCP/IP connection from a remote host is established, the user agent
must transmit the following sequence of bytes, represented here in
hexadecimal form: </p>
<pre>0x57 0x65 0x6C 0x63 0x6F 0x6E 0x65 0x0A</pre>

<p class="note">This says "Welcome" and a newline in UTF-8. </p>

<p>The user agent must then read all the bytes sent from the remote host, up
to the first 0x0A byte (inclusive). That string of bytes is then compared
byte-for-byte to the following string of bytes: </p>
<pre>0x48 0x65 0x6C 0x6C 0x6F 0x0A</pre>

<p class="note">"Hello" and a newline. </p>

<p>If the remote host sent back a string in any way different to this, then
the user agent must <a href="#closeConnection">close the connection</a> and
give up trying to connect. </p>

<p>Otherwise, the user agent must then take <a href="#the-string">the string
representing the script's domain in IDNA format</a>, encode it as UTF-8, and
send that to the remote host, followed by a 0x0A byte (a U+000A LINE FEED in
UTF-8). </p>

<p>The user agent must then read all the bytes sent from the remote host, up
to the first 0x0A byte (inclusive). That string of bytes must then be
compared byte-for-byte to the string that was just sent to that host (the one
with the IDNA domain name and ending with a newline character). If the remote
host sent back a string in any way different to this, then the user agent
must <a href="#closeConnection">close the connection</a> and give up trying
to connect. </p>

<p>Otherwise, the connection <a href="#openConnection">has been
established</a> (and events and so forth get fired, as described above). </p>

<p class="note">For author-written servers (as opposed to the server side of
a peer-to-peer connection), the script's domain would be replaced by the
hostname of the server. Alternatively, such servers might instead wait for
the client to send its domain string, and then simply echo it back. This
would allow connections from pages on any domain, instead of just pages
originating from the same host. The client compares the two strings to ensure
they are the same before allowing the connection to be used by author script.
</p>

<p>If at any point during this process the connection is closed prematurely,
then the user agent must <a href="#closeConnection">close the connection</a>
and give up trying to connect.</p>
<!-- XXX we should support automatic reconnect -->

<h3><dfn id="sending1">Sending and receiving data over TCP</dfn></h3>

<p>When the <code title="dom-Connection-send"><a href="#send">send(<var
title="">data</var>)</a></code> method is invoked on the connection's
corresponding <code><a href="#connection0">TCPConnection</a></code> object,
the user agent must take the <var title="">data</var> argument, replace any
U+0000 NULL and U+0017 END OF TRANSMISSION BLOCK characters in it with U+FFFD
REPLACEMENT CHARACTER characters, then transmit a U+0002 START OF TEXT
character, this new <var title="">data</var> string and a single U+0017 END
OF TRANSMISSION BLOCK character (in that order) to the remote host, all
encoded as UTF-8. </p>

<p>When the user agent receives bytes on the connection, the user agent must
buffer received bytes until it receives a 0x17 byte (a U+0017 END OF
TRANSMISSION BLOCK character). If the first buffered byte is not a 0x02 byte
(a U+0002 START OF TEXT character encoded as UTF-8) then all the data up to
the 0x17 byte, inclusive, must be dropped. (This allows for future extension
of this protocol.) Otherwise, all the data from (but not including) the 0x02
byte and up to (but not including) the 0x17 byte must be taken, interpreted
as a UTF-8 string, and a <code title="event-connection-read"><a
href="#read">read</a></code> event must be fired on the <code><a
href="#connection0">TCPConnection</a></code> object with that string as the
<code title="dom-ConnectionReadEvent-data"><a href="#data4">data</a></code>.
If that string cannot be decoded as UTF-8 without errors, the packet should
be ignored. </p>

<p class="note">This protocol does not yet allow binary data (e.g. an image
or video data) to be efficiently transmitted. A future version of this
protocol might allow this by using the prefix character U+001F INFORMATION
SEPARATOR ONE, followed by binary data which uses a particular byte (e.g.
0xFF) to encode byte 0x17 somehow (since otherwise 0x17 would be treated as
transmission end by down-level UAs).</p>

<h2 id="network-security">Security</h2>

<p class="issue">Need to write this section. </p>

<p class="issue">If you have an unencrypted page that is (through a
man-in-the-middle attack) changed, it can access a secure service that is
using IP authentication and then send that data back to the attacker. Ergo we
should probably stop unencrypted pages from accessing encrypted services, on
the principle that the actual level of security is zero. Then again, if we do
that, we prevent insecure sites from using SSL as a tunneling mechanism. </p>

<p class="issue">Should consider dropping the subdomain-only restriction. It
doesn't seem to add anything, and prevents cross-domain chatter. </p>

<h2 id="network-other-specs">Relationship to other standards</h2>

<p class="issue">Should have a section talking about the fact that we
blithely ignoring IANA's port assignments here.</p>

<p class="issue">Should explain why we are not reusing HTTP for this. (HTTP
is too heavy-weight for such a simple need; requiring authors to implement an
HTTP server just to have a party line is too much of a barrier to entry;
cannot rely on prebuilt components; having a simple protocol makes it much
easier to do RAD; HTTP doesn't fit the needs and doesn't have the security
model needed; etc)</p>
