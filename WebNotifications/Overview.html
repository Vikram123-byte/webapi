      This document defines an API for displaying simple notifications to the user.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="definitions"><h2>Definitions</h2>
    

    <ul>
      <li><em>ambient notification</em>: A notification which appears and disappears automatically without user action.</li>
      <li><em>interactive notification</em>: A notification which can receive events from user actions and deliver them to the application which created the notification.</li>
      <li><em>persistent notification</em>: A notification which is displayed until the user explicitly dismisses it.</li>
      <li><em>notification platform</em>: A notification platform is a system outside the user agent which provides desktop notifications.  Examples include Growl on MacOS, NotifyOSD on Linux, and the Windows notification API.</li>
      <li><em>simple notification</em>: A notification which consists only of an icon and one or two lines of text.</li>
      <li><em>web notification</em>: A notification which consists of Web platform content, such as HTML or SVG.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section id="requirements"><h2>Requirements and use cases</h2>
      
    This specification must meet the following requirements:
    <ul>
      <li>An implementation which uses only the existing notification platforms in major platforms to display notifications must be able to comply with the specification.</li>
      <li>The specification must allow compliant implementations regardless of platform or device.</li>
      <li>The specification must provide controls to users in order to prevent unwanted notifications to be displayed.</li>
      <li>The specification must define an event model for interactive notifications.</li>
      <li>The specification must address security issues.</li>
      <li>The specification should not require any implementation to display persistent notifications.</li>
      <li>The specification should be compatible with other Web technologies, such as HTML and SVG.</li>
    </ul>

    The specification attempts to address the following use cases:
    <ul>
      <li>An application alerts the user "you've got mail" in the form of an ambient notification, with no interaction necessary.</li>
      <li>An application alerts the user "you've got mail" as an interactive notification which allows the user to easily return to the inbox.</li>
      <li>A calendar application alerts the user for an upcoming meeting, and allows the user to easily specify a "snooze" delay of several possible time periods.</li>
      <li>A system alerts the user "your printer is out of paper".</li>
      <li>An application with multiple simultaneous execution contexts (like a multi-tab email application) wants to show notifications without creating duplicate notifications.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>
  
  <section id="introduction" class="informative"><h2>Introduction</h2>
    
    <p>
      This specification provides an API to generate <em>simple notifications</em> to
      alert users outside of the web page.  It does not specify exactly how a user
      agent should display these notifications; the best presentation depends on the device
      where the user agent is run.  When this specificiation refers to displaying
      notifications on the "desktop", it generally refers to some static display
      area outside the web page, but may take several forms, including:
      <ul>
        <li>a corner of the user's display,</li>
        <li>an area within the chrome of the user agent,</li>
        <li>the "home" screen of a mobile device,</li>
        <li><em>et al.</em></li>
      </ul>
      This specification does not define exactly how the user agent should display
      the notification, and the API is designed to be flexible with respect to
      presentation options.
    </p>
    <p>
      This specification is designed to be compatible with existing notification platforms
      as much as possible, but also to be platform-independent.  Since the common platforms
      do not provide the same functionality, this spec will indicate what events are guaranteed
      and which are not.  In particular, notifications as specified here only can contain
      text and icon content.  In the future, notifications generated from Web content may
      wish to contain Web content themselves, but that is outside the scope of this document.
    </p>    
    <p>
      In general, the event model for notifications is best-effort; while the Notification 
      object offers an "onclick" event, applications may enhance their functionality by
      listening for that event, but <em>must not depend on receiving it</em>,
      in case the underlying notification platform does not provide that capability.
    </p>
   
    <section id="security"><h3>Security</h3>
      
      <p>
	Notifications should only be presented when the user has indicated they are desired;
	without this they could create a negative experience for the user.
      </p>     
      </section>
  </section>

  <section id="permissions"><h2>Permissions</h2>
    
    <p>
      Permissions for notifications must be controlled using the Feature Permissions interface
      where Notifications are a privileged feature with unique id 'notifications'. [[!PERMISSIONS]]
    </p>

    <p>
      Throughout this document, "notification permission is allowed" shall mean that 
      the permission level of the 'notifications' feature for the current
      security origin is <code>USER_ALLOWED</code>  or <code>DEFAULT_ALLOWED</code>
      in the meaning of [[!PERMISSIONS]], and "notification permission is denied" shall mean 
      that the current permission level has some other value.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="idl-if-Notification"><h2>The Notification interface</h2>
    
    <p>
      The Notification interface represents a single notification to be shown to the user. It extends the EventTarget interface defined in [[!DOM-LEVEL-3-EVENTS]].

	The <code>dir</code> attribute of the <code>Notification</code> interface has

      </p>
      <p>
        In environments where the global object is represented by the <code>Window</code>
	object, if the notification's directionality state is not <em>ltr</em> or <em>rtl</em>,

  <section id="algorithms"><h2>Queueing and displaying notifications</h2>
    
    <section id="queueing-notifications"><h3>Queueing notifications</h3>
      
      <p>
	If the device allows notifications to displayed immediately without limitations on
	the number of concurrent notifications, it must display a notification immediately
	whenever <code>show</code> is called and notification permission is allowed.
      </p>

      <p>
	If the device does have limitations on the number of concurrent notifications,
	when <code>show</code> is called and notification permission is allowed,
	the user agent must either immediately call to a notifications platform which 
	supports queueing, or use the following algorithm.
      </p>
      <p>
	The user agent must keep a <em>queue of pending notifications</em> and a <em>list of active notifications</em>. 
      </p>
      <ol>
	<li>Get the replacement id of the notification to be shown, and let it be replaceId.</li>
	<li>
	  If replaceId is defined, examine all the notifications in the <em>list of active notifications</em>.
	  If any notification in the list has the same source origin and has replacement id equal to replaceId,
	  do the following steps and then terminate this algorithm.  Let <em>existing</em> be the notification in the list
	  which matches.
	  <ol>
	    <li>Replace <em>existing</em> with the new notification using the <a href="#replacing">replacing a notification</a> algorithm.</li>
	    <li>If the replacement returned error information, stop.</li>
	    <li>Remove <em>existing</em> from the <em>list of active notifications</em>.</li>
	    <li>Add the new notification to the <em>list of active notifications</em>.</li>
  </ol>
	</li>
	<li>Add the notification to the <em>queue of pending notifications</em>.</li>
	<li>Wait until there is available space on the device.</li>
	<li>Display the first notification in the <em>queue of pending notifications</em> using 
	  the <a href="#displaying">displaying a notification</a> algorithm.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
	When the available display space changes on the device such that a new notification may be
	displayed, for example due to a previous notification being dismissed, the user agent should
	<a href="#displaying">display</a> the first notification in the queue using the procedure described above.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="displaying"><h3>Displaying notifications</h3>
      
      <p>
	When a user agent is to <em>display a notification</em>, the user agent should perform the following steps:
	<ol>
	  <li>
	    Fetch the resource given by <code>iconUrl</code> using the algorithm defined in [[!HTML5]].
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    If the fetch algorithm returns error information, fire the <code>error</code> event on the notification
	    object and stop executing this algorithm.
	  </li>
	  <li>Fire the <code>show</code> event on the notification object.</li>
	  <li>Show the notification on the device, such as by calling the appropriate notification platform.</li>
	</ol>

    </section>

    <section id="replacing"><h3>Replacing a notification</h3>
      
      <p>
	When a user agent is to <em>replace a notification</em>, the user agent should perform the following steps.
	Let <em>old</em> be the notification to be replaced by <em>new</em>.
	<ol>
	  <li>
	    Fetch the icon resource in <em>new</em> using the algorithm defined in [[!HTML5]].
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    If the fetch algorithm returns error information, fire the <code>error</code> event on the <em>new</em> notification

  <section id="interactions" class="informative"><h2>Interacting with notifications</h2>
    
    <section id="using-events"><h3>Using events</h3>
      
      <p>
	Notification objects dispatch events during their lifecycle, which authors can use
	to generate desired behaviors.
      </p>
      <p>
	The <code>show</code> event occurs when the notification is shown to the user -- 
	this may be at some time after the <code>show()</code> method is called in the case
	of limited display space and a queue.
      </p>

      <p>
	In the following example, this event is used to guarantee that regardless of when
	the notification is shown, it is displayed for only 15 seconds.
      </p>

      <pre class="example" title="">var notification = new Notification("mail.png", "New Email Received");
notification.onshow = function() { setTimeout(notification.cancel(), 15000); }
notification.show();</pre>

      <p>
	The <code>close</code> events occurs when the notification is dismissed by the user.
	Authors may use this event to perform actions when notifications are acknowledged.
      </p>
      <p>
	In the following example, when a meeting reminder notification is acknowledged, the
	application suppresses other forms of reminders.
      </p>

      <pre class="example" title="">var notification = new Notification("calendar.png", "Meeting about to begin", "Room 101");
notification.onclose = function() { cancelReminders(event); }
notification.show();</pre>
